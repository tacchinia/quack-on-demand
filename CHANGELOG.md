# Changelog

## 0.9.7

- **A read-only REST data edge serves tables and views as HTTP resources (#120).** HTTP-only tools
  (n8n, Zapier, a spreadsheet import, a cache) can now read governed data without a driver or SQL.
  `QOD_REST_ENABLED=true` opens a fifth listener on `:31339` (`QOD_REST_PORT`, TLS on by default
  and reusing the FlightSQL edge's PEM pair, `QOD_REST_TLS_ENABLED`) with four `GET` endpoints under
  `/api/v1/tenant/{tenant}/database/{db}`: `/schemas`, `/schemas/{s}/tables`,
  `/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}` and `/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}/rows`, answering JSON (an array of
  objects, exact decimals) or CSV (RFC 4180) by `format=` or `Accept`. `/rows` takes `select`,
  column filters (`eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `like`, `ilike`, `in`, `is`, each
  negatable with `not.`), `order`, `limit`/`offset` and, on DuckLake, `asOf`/`asOfTag`/`asOfTs`;
  every DuckLake page carries `X-QoD-Snapshot`, and sending it back as `asOf` keeps paging stable
  under concurrent writes. Each request becomes one `SELECT` through the same routed executor as
  MCP `run_sql`, so grants, row and column policies, pool permissions, audit (origin `rest`),
  statement history and metering apply unchanged; an object the caller may not read answers the
  same `404` as a missing one. Credentials are personal access tokens only (never the static API
  key, a cookie or a password; a superuser token is refused): a token with no `tools` restriction
  may use the edge, and one restricted with `qod auth pat create --tool ...` must list the reserved
  name `rest`. Rows are capped by `min(limit or QOD_REST_DEFAULT_LIMIT, QOD_REST_MAX_ROWS, the
  token's maxRows)` with `X-QoD-Truncated` when a server or token cap cut the page, and each
  statement is bounded by `QOD_REST_STMT_TIMEOUT_SEC` (504) and a hibernated pool answers `503
  pool_resuming` with `Retry-After`. Responses are `Cache-Control: private` with `Vary:
  Authorization`, and cacheable for five minutes only when pinned to a snapshot. The Helm chart
  gains `rest.enabled` (off by default), `rest.tls.enabled`, a `<release>-rest` Service
  (`service.restData`) and its NetworkPolicy port; the image exposes `31339`. There is no per-client
  rate limit yet: an internet-facing edge must sit behind a reverse proxy or WAF that rate-limits
  per client and per `Authorization` value.

## 0.9.6

- **`ATTACH ... (TYPE quack)` now works for users holding column policies, and their masks hold on
  the pushed-down scans (#114, second report).** Two gaps behind one symptom. First, the column-level
  security rewriter runs the attach-time catalog sync (`duckdb_tables() UNION ALL duckdb_views()`)
  through its column resolver, which cannot model a table function and reported a parse failure,
  denied fail-closed: `column policy rewrite could not parse statement`. A statement that reads no
  physical table, only the four filterable catalog functions, now passes that rewriter (decided on
  the ACL parser's complete walk, so a policy-bearing table hidden in any subquery still reaches the
  resolver; batches and other table functions keep the fail-closed path). Second, and worse once the
  first was fixed: the quack client pushes every scan down as `SELECT #1, #2 FROM <table>`, DuckDB
  positional references with no column names, so the resolver saw nothing to mask and forwarded the
  scan unmasked. Positional references are now resolved against the table's physical column order
  before the mask runs, for the one shape whose numbering is unambiguous (a single-table SELECT with
  no join, subquery or set operation, `#n` in the projection, WHERE or an expression); a `#n` as an
  ORDER BY, GROUP BY or HAVING term, in a join or derived table, out of range, or on a table the
  catalog does not know is denied rather than guessed. `QuackCompatibilitySpec` attaches with a
  column mask and a row policy in force and asserts the masked value on a pushed-down scan.

- **Bare references to DuckDB's system views no longer pass a schema-wide grant.** DuckDB keeps
  default views in the `system` catalog's `main` and `pg_catalog` schemas, both on the unqualified
  search path, so `FROM sqlite_master` (every catalog's DDL), `FROM pg_class` / `FROM pg_attribute`
  (every catalog's relation and column names), `FROM duckdb_databases` (every attached catalog and
  its path) and the rest resolve on a node whenever no table of that name shadows them. The ACL
  parser qualified such a name as `<session>.<schema>.<name>` and grant-checked that, so a
  `acme.*.* RO` grant admitted an unfiltered read of the system view. All 36 default views of DuckDB
  1.5.5, plus any `duckdb_` / `pragma_` / `sqlite_` prefixed bare name, are now marked unsupported
  (denied without a wildcard ALL grant, flag on or off), completing the `duckdb_tables` case of
  0.9.5. A three-part name under a real catalog, and an explicit `pg_catalog.X` (the documented,
  schema-grant-gated surface), are unchanged. `DuckDbSystemViewsSpec` pins the list against the
  `duckdb` CLI so a DuckDB bump that adds a view fails the build.

## 0.9.5

- **Native `ATTACH ... (TYPE quack)` now works for ordinary users (#114).** The DuckDB quack
  client syncs the remote catalog on attach with `duckdb_tables() UNION ALL duckdb_views()`, and the
  ACL gate denied that query for every principal without a `*.*.*` ALL grant (`unsupported
  constructs (deny, fail-closed): table function duckdb_tables`), so only superusers could attach.
  The filtered-metadata rewriter now covers DuckDB's four catalog functions (`duckdb_tables()`,
  `duckdb_views()`, `duckdb_schemas()`, `duckdb_columns()`) the way it covers `information_schema`:
  an unqualified, argument-free call in a read-only statement is narrowed to the session catalog
  (`database_name = '<session>'`) and the principal's Read-covering grants, under the same
  `QOD_ACL_FILTERED_METADATA` flag. An attached catalog therefore lists only the tables the user is
  granted; an ungranted table is absent on the client rather than described. Fail-closed as before:
  calls with arguments, qualified calls (`main.duckdb_tables()`), `ROWS FROM`, positions the
  rewriter cannot reach, and a catalog function riding inside a write or DDL statement are denied.
  Also closed while here: the bare spelling `FROM duckdb_tables` (no parentheses), which DuckDB
  resolves to the same function, used to be qualified as an ordinary table and admitted under any
  schema-wide grant, exposing the DDL of every catalog on the node. The ACL parser now marks the
  unqualified, `main.` and `system.main.` spellings unsupported (denied without wildcard ALL, flag on
  or off). `QuackCompatibilitySpec` drives the real DuckDB CLI through the real
  `PostgresAclValidator` with narrow grants instead of a stand-in that admitted everything, and
  `QuackClientSyncFunctionsSpec` pins the vendored client's sync queries to the filterable set, so a
  client bump that syncs through an unlisted function fails the build instead of re-opening #114.

## 0.9.4

- **External Iceberg REST catalogs as a typed federated source.** A tenant-db can now attach an
  Iceberg REST catalog (`qod federation create TENANT DB --alias icelake --type iceberg-rest --uri
  ... --warehouse ...`, `POST /api/tenants/{tenant}/tenant-dbs/{tenantDb}/federated-sources` with a
  typed `config`, the admin console's federation section, or `sourceType: iceberg_rest` in a
  control-plane manifest) instead of hand-written `setupSql`. QoD renders the `ATTACH` itself, so
  the catalog is governed like any other: ACL grants reference it as the first segment of a
  three-part table ref, and every statement goes through the usual routing pipeline. A new `iceberg_rest` source defaults to **read-only**, which
  is enforced twice: `READ_ONLY` on the rendered `ATTACH` (engine-level, from the next node spawn)
  and a new edge screen that refuses a write it can resolve against a read-only catalog before it
  reaches a node. Credentials stay in the federation secret store, never in the rendered SQL a
  `kubectl describe` or an error message can echo. A catalog that is unreachable at node spawn no
  longer disappears silently: the node still comes up healthy serving its other catalogs, the real
  DuckDB error is reported on the node and on the source, and the next health probe re-attaches it
  without a restart.

- **BREAKING: every federated source alias must now be a plain lowercase identifier.** The rule
  that already applied to tenant, tenant-db and pool names (ASCII letters, digits and underscore,
  starting with a letter or underscore, 1..63 chars, stored lowercase) now applies to federated
  aliases too -- **`sql` sources included, not only the new `iceberg_rest` ones**. DuckDB treats
  catalog and secret names case-insensitively, so `Sales` and `sales` were two rows whose second
  `ATTACH` failed at node spawn, and a hyphenated alias needed hand-quoting to attach at all.
  What changes for an existing install:
  - Creating a source with a hyphen, a dot, or an over-63-char alias (`--alias ext-s3`) now
    returns `400` where it previously worked. Pick an identifier alias (`ext_s3`).
  - A mixed-case alias is rewritten to lowercase in place on its next upsert. `Sales_Lake` and
    `sales_lake` resolve to one row rather than minting a second.
  - A source **already stored** under an alias the rule rejects stays editable: an update naming
    that alias keeps the stored spelling and applies the edit, through REST, CLI, MCP and manifest
    import alike. Only its NAME is frozen -- renaming it to a valid alias still means delete and
    recreate, and because the alias is the catalog segment of every role permission, that also
    means re-granting.
  - The manager reports every stored alias the rule would reject or rewrite at boot, at ERROR, so
    an upgrade tells you which rows are affected before you go looking.

- **Encryption at rest for tenant databases.** `qod database create --encrypted` (REST
  `"encrypted": true`, the same switch on the admin console's create form, `encrypted` in a
  control-plane manifest) makes a `kind=ducklake` database write encrypted Parquet, with DuckLake
  minting a key per file into its own catalog, and a `kind=duckdb-file` database an AES-256-GCM
  encrypted file whose key QoD mints per database (or you supply with `--encryption-key`). The key
  is never readable back through any API, so an exported manifest cannot recreate an encrypted
  `duckdb-file` database. `kind=memory` is refused. Encryption is create-time only in both
  directions for both kinds, since neither engine can encrypt or decrypt a database in place: there
  is no `encrypted` field on `database/update`, a manifest import that flips it is refused, and a
  pre-attach guard turns a control-plane row that disagrees with the catalog's recorded
  `ducklake_metadata.encrypted` into one clear message instead of a DuckDB error repeated once per
  node spawn. A branch inherits its parent's encryption. `QOD_REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION=true` (default
  off) refuses any create that does not ask for encryption, gating creates only so existing
  databases keep working. Encrypted nodes load `httpfs`, because DuckDB needs OpenSSL for a
  writable encrypted file. **Kubernetes upgrade note:** node credentials (`pgPassword`, and
  `encryptionKey` for encrypted `duckdb-file` databases) now reach a pod through a per-pool Secret
  instead of the pod's plain environment, and pods created by an earlier manager are not migrated
  in place, so restart every node after upgrading. The trust boundary is stated in the README:
  whoever can read the control-plane Postgres can decrypt the data, for both kinds.

- **Native Quack protocol front door (Epic 5).** Any DuckDB that carries the `quack` extension
  (the CLI, the Python package, an embedded DuckDB) can now `ATTACH 'quack:<manager>:9494' AS qod
  (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'tenant=<t>&pool=<p>&user=<u>&password=<pw>')` or call
  `quack_query('quack:<manager>:9494', ...)` against the manager directly, with no driver in
  between, and join the attached catalog with its local tables. The token string is the same
  set of parameters a FlightSQL JDBC URL takes after `?` (`tenant`, `pool`, `user`, `password`,
  or `token=<OIDC JWT>`, plus `superuser=true` for the system realm). Identity goes through the
  Flight edge's own handshake (extracted into a shared `EdgeHandshake`), and every statement runs
  through the same routing pipeline as FlightSQL (`FlightSqlRouter.executeWith`, the pipeline
  generalized over the node call): ACL, column and row policies, metadata filtering, lockdown,
  author stamping, retry, statement history, audit (source `quack`), kill and scale-to-zero
  wake-up all apply unchanged. The manager relays per statement: it parses only the Quack header
  and the small request messages, opens one raw node connection per statement with the client's
  own protocol hello, and forwards the node's result bytes to the client untouched, so it never
  encodes a DuckDB chunk and has no protocol version of its own (both the shipped generation 1
  extension and the current upstream generation 3 wire are accepted). A generation 1 `INSERT`
  into an attached table (shipped as an APPEND) is authorized as a write on the named table
  before any byte reaches a node, and admin-dialect statements are answered by the manager and
  rendered through a node. New `quack-native` config block (`QOD_QUACK_ENABLED`, `_HOST`,
  `_PORT` default 9494, `_TLS_ENABLED` default false because the DuckDB client only speaks plain
  HTTP to loopback hosts, `_TLS_CERT_CHAIN`, `_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY`, `_MAX_HEARTBEAT_SEC`,
  `_MAX_BODY_BYTES`); the port is exposed in the Dockerfile, docker-compose and the helm chart
  (`service.quack`, `quack.enabled`, `quack.tls.enabled`); the boot banner, `qod serve`'s connect
  box and the pool page's connection card print the `ATTACH` string. Sessions are per replica
  like FlightSQL sessions, so an HA deployment needs a session-sticky balancer in front of the
  port. Known upstream client limitation (extension `40de7ba`, DuckDB 1.5.4): multi-column
  results larger than the inline batch (about 24k rows) fail inside the client with
  `Attempted to access index 1 within vector of size 1`, against a raw node as well; single-column
  results of any size and multi-column results that fit inline work. Covered by an end-to-end
  spec that drives the real DuckDB CLI and the `uv`-provisioned Python client through the front
  door to a real `quack_serve` node. Design note:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-native-quack-front-door-design.md`.

- **FlightSQL edge no longer mis-surfaces two DDL/DML edge cases as opaque or drifted errors.**
  DuckDB (1.5.x) does not stream every non-result statement as the single-row `Count BIGINT`
  the edge advertises: BEGIN, COMMIT, DROP and ALTER stream a single-row `Success: BOOLEAN`
  instead (a split that does not track the classifier's Read/Write/Ddl buckets - CREATE INDEX
  streams Count but DROP INDEX streams Success; VACUUM/ANALYZE/SET share the DuckDB-level split
  but are always probed and advertised correctly, so they never drift). This tripped ADBC's
  advertised-vs-actual schema check (`FlightSQL endpoint returned inconsistent schema`) and, on
  a stamped ducklake write whose result had already streamed, could crash the DoGet stream
  entirely after the first batch. Both are now handled at the one place literal and prepared
  statements funnel through: a `Success: BOOLEAN` result (any row count - DuckDB can report zero
  materialized rows for the shape) is coerced to the advertised `Count: int64 = 0` before
  streaming, with a WARN if that ever discards real row data (believed impossible for DML/DDL).
  Separately, a stamped write's COMMIT epilogue losing a genuine DuckLake write-write conflict
  (the same "contains conflict" marker `CatalogRestoreHandlers.isConflict` already relies on) is
  now classified as a retryable `UNAVAILABLE` ("concurrent write conflict committing the
  transaction; retry the statement") instead of an opaque internal error - but only for that
  known-transient signature: any other commit-time failure (disk full, a corrupted catalog,
  revoked write credentials) still fails closed to the errorId'd internal error, now always
  logged at ERROR with its own correlation id so an operator sees it even at the manager's
  default quiet log level. Neither statement kind ever carried a meaningful row count and the
  underlying DuckLake write race itself is not retried by the manager. Fixes #106.
- **HA: PAT kill broadcasts are chunked.** Revoking a token cascades the kill of its running
  statements to the other replicas over the `qod_pat_kill` NOTIFY channel. Postgres caps a
  NOTIFY payload at 8000 bytes, so a large revocation cascade (roughly 190+ ids) used to be
  dropped with a WARN and the remote statements ran on to their own timeouts. The id set is now
  sent in batches of 100 (about 4 KB each), one NOTIFY per batch; receiver and payload schema are
  unchanged. Refs #86 (item 1).
- **Federation store connections now carry connect/socket timeouts, and restore() no longer
  resolves the federation blob for tenant-dbs that have no federated sources.**
  `FederatedSourceStore` opened a fresh JDBC connection per call with no `socketTimeout`, so a
  half-dead federation Postgres could hang any caller indefinitely - including manager boot,
  since `PoolSupervisor.restore()` re-resolves the federation blob per tenant-db on every boot
  and HA topology NOTIFY. The store's connections now carry `connectTimeout`/`socketTimeout`
  (10s/30s, never overriding a value the caller's URL already sets), `restore()` skips
  resolution entirely for a tenant-db with no federated sources (one cheap set-query per
  restore instead of a connection per tenant-db), and the resolution that does happen is bounded
  by a 15s timeout, degrading to the existing WARN-and-fallback path instead of hanging. Fixes
  #101.
- **`qod stop` sweeps an orphaned embedded control-plane postmaster** left behind by
  an abrupt JVM death (an orphan case mostly seen on Windows). The pid is checked
  twice before anything is signaled: a pid of 0 or negative is refused outright
  (those have process-group-wide meanings to `os.kill`, never a single targeted
  process), and the pid must still identify as a `postgres`/`postgres.exe` process
  (`ps -p <pid> -o comm=` on POSIX, `tasklist` on win32) before it is terminated,
  since the pid in a stale pidfile can be recycled by an unrelated process.
- **`qod serve` waits for a routable node** before printing its connect-string
  banner on a restart, instead of handing out strings that briefly fail while a
  respawned node is still warming up.
- **`qod serve`/`qod start` print a non-blocking one-line nudge** when a newer
  release is on PyPI.
- **Lockdown now covers the `qod serve` scheme aliases.** A lockdown-enabled node
  disables local filesystem access for the s3a/r2/gcs/azure/abfss dataPath scheme
  aliases, not just their s3/gs/az canonical forms.
- **`qod serve` notes a `--table` view's mismatched object-store scheme.** When a
  view's glob lives under a different scheme family than the target's own, it gets
  no scoped secret and falls back to the engine's ambient credential chain - now
  flagged instead of silent.
- **`qod serve <target>` provisions into an already-running LOOPBACK manager**
  instead of failing partway through a second JVM boot: it attaches in the
  foreground using the stored or exported admin password (never generating a
  fresh one, since that could not match a manager already up), or refuses with a
  clear message when no password is available. A manager running at a
  non-loopback URL is refused outright rather than attached to, since that is
  almost certainly a `qod login` profile against a remote deployment. `qod serve
  --demo` refuses outright when a manager is already running, since the demo's
  insecure posture must never land on someone else's gateway.
- **On Windows, an interrupted `qod serve`/`qod start` runs the stop sweep**
  before exiting, instead of leaving the shared console's Ctrl-C delivery to the
  child process as the only cleanup. (#100)

## 0.9.2

- **`qod serve <target>` takes you from your own data to a queryable gateway
  in one command.** Point it at a `.duckdb` file, a parquet/csv file, a
  directory or glob of them, an `s3://`/`gs://`/`az://` prefix, or nothing at
  all for a fresh empty DuckLake, and it provisions a tenant, database, and
  pool around it, then prints the client connection strings. Every step is
  ensure-semantics (create only what is missing), so a failed or interrupted
  run just resumes on re-run, and `qod serve ./other.duckdb` adds a second
  database beside the first instead of replacing it. Unlike `qod serve
  --demo`, this path is persistent and keeps the normal secure posture: TLS
  on, DB auth on, ACL on by default (overridable, with a loud warning), and a
  random admin password generated on the first run, printed once, and stored
  in the CLI config file (a real `QOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` still wins); the saved
  CLI profile authenticates `qod sql` as the superuser realm out of the box.
- **The manager can run its control plane on a persistent embedded Postgres**
  (`QOD_PG_EMBEDDED`, single-node only - HA refuses to boot with it set)
  instead of requiring an external Postgres already running, which is what
  lets `qod serve` need nothing but a JVM. It lives at a fixed data
  directory and port (`--pg-port`/`--pg-data-dir` or
  `QOD_PG_EMBEDDED_PORT`/`QOD_PG_EMBEDDED_DATA_DIR`), persists across
  restarts, and is never deleted. `qod status` now live-probes it instead of
  just reading a pidfile.
- **`qod serve --demo` is now the canonical form of the self-contained demo**
  (embedded ephemeral Postgres, seeded TPC-H, deliberately insecure); `qod
  start --demo` still works, as a deprecated alias.
- **`qod database create --kind duckdb-file` defaults `dbName`/`schemaName`**
  to the database's own name and `main`, since neither is a real choice for a
  plain file - the DuckLake vocabulary was pure friction there. Anything the
  caller passes still wins.
- Fixed: `objectStoreSql` was only ever emitted for DuckLake tenant-dbs; every
  kind (including `duckdb-file` and `memory`) now gets its per-database
  `CREATE SECRET` when it carries object-store credentials.
- Fixed: a `memory`-kind tenant-db (loose parquet/csv views, no catalog) can
  now carry an object-store scope, needed for `qod serve` targets that serve
  views over a remote prefix.
- Fixed: pools rehydrated after a manager restart or HA NOTIFY lost their
  resolved federation blob (and, before that fix landed, their tenant-db
  kind); respawned and resumed nodes now boot with their federation ATTACH
  aliases intact.

## 0.8.5

- **The demo starts on arm64 instead of dying on missing Postgres
  binaries.** `qod start --demo` failed on Linux arm64 (Graviton, ARM VMs,
  containers on Apple Silicon) with zonky's `IllegalStateException: Missing
  embedded postgres binaries`. The build declared only `embedded-postgres`,
  whose transitive binary set is amd64 only, and zonky resolves binaries
  strictly from the classpath: its single emulation fallback covers
  Darwin/aarch64 and Windows on ARM, never Linux, so there was nothing left
  to try. The Linux and macOS arm64 binaries are now bundled. That also
  takes Apple Silicon off the Rosetta path, where the demo had been running
  an emulated Postgres behind a WARN the default `QOD_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR`
  hides, and failed outright when Rosetta was not installed. The uber-jar
  grows by about 40 MB.
- **`qod start --demo` no longer trips over the home a crashed run left
  behind.** A demo killed before its teardown (SIGKILL, machine sleep, OOM,
  or a second demo sharing the default `${TMPDIR}/qod-demo`) leaves
  `pg/pgdata` populated, and the next run's `initdb` refuses it with
  `directory "..." exists but is not empty`. That surfaced only as zonky's
  opaque `IllegalStateException: Process [...initdb...] failed`, since
  initdb's stderr goes to an INFO logger the default `QOD_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR`
  swallows, and the failed run's own cleanup then deleted the home, so the
  run after it succeeded and the whole thing looked random. `DemoHome.create`
  now clears the three subdirectories the demo owns (`pg`, `ducklake`,
  `native`, never the caller-supplied root) before creating them. Because
  that clean is destructive it refuses to run while a demo is still live on
  the home, keyed off Postgres's own `postmaster.pid` plus a pid-liveness
  check, and if the clean does not take it fails fast naming the directory
  to remove instead of landing back on the unreadable initdb error. A failed
  embedded-Postgres start now also reports the underlying cause rather than
  the wrapper exception.
- **jsqltranspiler 1.12 and jsqlparser 5.4.2.** The two move in lockstep
  because jsqltranspiler's pom pins the parser version. 1.12 carries the
  upstream fix overriding the `PivotQuery` visit methods that the 5.3 to 5.4
  visitor interface change required; 1.11 was built against 5.3.336 and
  would have run that path on an interface it does not implement.

## 0.8.4

- **The operator skill ships to users instead of living in the source
  tree.** Two install channels: `qod skill install` bundles it in the
  wheel and asks which LLM to install for (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot,
  Gemini CLI; `--platform claude|copilot|gemini|all` skips the prompt,
  `--project` targets the working directory, `--dir` names an exact
  target), and the repo is now a Claude Code plugin marketplace
  (`/plugin marketplace add starlake-ai/quack-on-demand`, then
  `/plugin install quack-on-demand@quack-on-demand`). The skill itself was
  rewritten to be checkout-free: every manager REST curl recipe is now the
  equivalent `qod` command, booting goes through `qod setup/start/status/stop`,
  and repo paths, sbt invocations and raw `qodstate` INSERT advice are gone.
  curl remains only where no CLI equivalent exists (the PyPI version probe,
  SCIM, federation YAML export/import). The operating agent also compares
  `qod --version` against PyPI and asks the user to upgrade when stale,
  never upgrading unprompted.
- **Bare `USE <schema>` now resolves against the tenant database.** On a
  node the DuckLake catalog is attached under the tenant-db name while the
  session's current catalog is the transient memory db, so a client issuing
  `USE star1` got "No catalog + schema named star1 found" even though
  `<dbName>.star1` existed, with no way to learn the physical database name.
  The edge now qualifies a bare one-part `USE x` into `USE <dbName>.x`.
  Two-part `USE a.b`, `USE <dbName>` and `USE memory` pass through
  untouched, so catalog switching still works.
- **Admin UI: the Nodes page shows the last 200 statements** instead of 50.
  The router's ring buffer holds 256 records and the endpoint caps at 500,
  so this is a display change only.
- **Admin UI: the "Starlake" nav entry is now labelled "Workbench".**

## 0.8.3

- **Manager creates the control-plane database at startup.** The boot
  preflight now classifies the initial connect failure: when the server is
  reachable but the control-plane database is missing (SQLState `3D000`), it
  is created through the admin database (`PG_ADMIN_DB`, default `postgres`)
  and boot proceeds, logging `control-plane database '<db>' did not exist;
  created it`. Every other failure (server unreachable, bad credentials)
  still refuses to start with the existing operator message. This removes
  the launchers' `psql` dependency: a fresh install needs only a Postgres
  user with `CREATEDB`. The `psql` preflight arms in `run-jar.sh` and the
  CLI remain as optional fail-fast conveniences.
- **Local rigs: reverted to SeaweedFS as the bundled object store** (the
  0.8.2 RustFS replacement is rolled back); the wrapper-script hardening
  from that work is retained (env precedence, data-path-derived seeding,
  port handling).
- **`qod sql --file` runs a SQL script fail-fast.** Statements split on
  top-level semicolons with full lexical awareness (strings, quoted
  identifiers, comments, dollar-quoting), executed in order; the first
  error aborts with exit 1 naming the statement and its line. `-` reads
  stdin.
- **`NUKE=1` asks for typed confirmation on a terminal.** All four launch
  surfaces (compose wrapper, `run-jar.sh`, the kind rig, `qod start`) now
  require typing the destruction target's name before wiping; non-tty runs
  skip the prompt, so scripts and CI are unchanged. There is deliberately
  no bypass env var.

## 0.8.2

- **`qod setup`: configure `qod start` once.** New CLI command persisting the
  env vars `qod start` reads (Postgres coordinates, admin credentials, API
  key, auth/TLS toggles, arbitrary `QOD_*`/`PROXY_*` via `--set`) into the
  CLI config file under a `[start]` table; guided prompts on a terminal,
  flags/`--set`/`--unset`/`--show` for scripts. A real shell export still
  wins, and `qod start --demo` deliberately ignores the stored config.
  Before saving, connection coordinates are verified (TCP probe, plus a
  `SELECT 1` login check when `psql` is on `PATH`); `--skip-checks` opts out.
- **`qod status`: one glance at what is running.** Manager `/health` and
  `/ready`, FlightSQL edge coordinates with a live port check, local manager
  pids, per-pool healthy/total nodes when logged in, and the stored setup
  summary. Exits 1 when the manager is unreachable, for scripting.
- **Local rigs: SeaweedFS replaced by RustFS** (kind local-stack and docker
  compose). BREAKING (dev rigs): the compose profile is now `rustfs` (was
  `seaweedfs`), data dir `./rustfs` (env `RUSTFS_DIR`), S3 endpoint
  `rustfs:9000`; a stale `seaweedfs` endpoint in `.env` warns instead of
  half-starting. RustFS does not auto-create buckets, so both rigs run a
  one-shot bucket-create step before the stack serves.
- **Compose wrapper hardening.** The wrapper script now honors the repo-wide
  precedence everywhere (process env wins over `.env`, incl. `PG_PORT` and
  profile auto-detection, scheme-tolerant endpoint matching); demo seeding
  derives its DuckLake data path from `QOD_DUCKLAKE_DATA_PATH` exactly as
  the manager does (trailing slashes and nested or local roots included), so
  S3-mode seeding no longer mismatches the catalog; data/cert/store dirs are
  prepared with correct ownership on every run, not only under `NUKE=1`.
- **Fix: demo seeding inside released images.** `scripts/_load-common.sh`
  was never copied into the Docker image after the loader refactor, so
  in-pod `LOAD_TPCH` seeding failed in every released image since; the
  image now ships it.
- **Helm chart published as an OCI artifact.** Every release pushes the
  chart to `oci://ghcr.io/starlake-ai/charts/quack-on-demand`, stamped to
  the release version; the chart's node-pod image now defaults to the
  release `appVersion` instead of `latest-snapshot`, so a versioned chart
  deploys versioned images throughout.

## 0.8.1

- **MCP full admin surface.** The MCP endpoint (`POST /mcp`) now exposes the complete
  admin control plane to agents: tenants, users, groups, roles, memberships, role table
  permissions, column/row policies, pool permissions, pool lifecycle and settings,
  tenant-dbs, maintenance policies, tags (including delete and protect/unprotect),
  restore/undrop, federated sources and secrets, manifest export/import, self-scoped
  PATs, server config, and statement/usage telemetry - 69 new tools (91 registered in
  total) across the identity, access, and platform tiers. This supersedes the
  2026-08-18 deny-list decision: destructive operations are exposed and rely on the
  same server-side guards REST uses (superuser gates, tenant scope checks, self/floor
  guards, mutation gates, audit). `protect_tag` now toggles both directions and
  `delete_tag` is available; PAT tools remain self-scoped (an agent manages only its
  own token subtree). A coverage spec (`McpCoverageSpec`) now fails the build if a
  REST mutation route is added without an MCP tool or an explicit exclusion.
- **SQL admin dialect: audit and history parity with REST.** Admin statements
  executed over FlightSQL (`GRANT`, `CREATE ROLE`, `CREATE USER`, policy DDL,
  ...) now land in statement history and metrics with the SQL redacted, and
  emit the same `AuditActions` events REST already emits for the equivalent
  call - including denials and parse failures, which previously left only a
  WARN log line.
- **Fix: a claim-shaped statement on a non-dialect path could leak a
  password into history.** A statement that *looked* like admin SQL (e.g.
  `CREATE USER ... PASSWORD '...'`) on a path the dialect does not serve -
  MCP, or `QOD_SQL_ADMIN_ENABLED=false` - recorded the raw SQL in statement
  history when denied, and when admitted and forwarded, the node's parser
  error (which quotes the statement, password literal included) was recorded
  in the history error column.
  Both the SQL and the error text are now redacted for claim-shaped
  statements on every path, not just the ones the dialect actually executes.
- **Parser: dollar-quoted and E-string literals now tokenize inside
  expressions.** `$$...$$` and `E'...'` in a row/column policy expression
  used to make `claims()` return false, so the statement fell through to the
  node and failed with a confusing DuckDB parser error instead of an admin
  one. Comments are now rejected everywhere in an expression body instead of
  being accepted in some shapes and not others.
- **`CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE` is now claimed** and answered with a proper
  admin error instead of falling through to a raw DuckDB parser error.
- **`GRANT ... TO USER` on a table grant now gives a targeted error.**
  `GRANT SELECT ON t TO USER alice` used to absorb `USER` as the role name
  and fail with a confusing "unexpected trailing input: 'alice'"; it now
  names the actual problem (roles only, not `USER`/`GROUP`, in the table
  grant arm).
- **New statements:** `SHOW GRANTS FOR USER u` (the user's effective grant
  set, flattened through role and group membership), `ALTER USER u REQUIRE
  PASSWORD CHANGE`, and `ALTER USER u ENABLE` / `DISABLE`.
- **BREAKING (narrow): `POST /api/user/update` with `mustChangePassword` and
  no `password` now succeeds.** It previously returned `400
  invalid_argument`, refusing a flag-only update. Setting
  `mustChangePassword` (or `enabled`) without also sending a new password is
  now a supported, standalone update.

## 0.8.0

- **SQL admin dialect over FlightSQL.** Admin-gated SQL statements sent
  through the FlightSQL edge are now answered directly by the manager and
  never forwarded to a node: `GRANT` / `REVOKE` table ACLs, row and column
  policies (including masking), role/group management and membership,
  `GRANT` / `REVOKE` pool `CONNECT`, and user management (`CREATE USER`,
  `ALTER USER ... PASSWORD`, `DROP USER`). `SHOW` introspection covers roles,
  grants, row/column policies, pool grants, and `SHOW USERS`. Behind
  `QOD_SQL_ADMIN_ENABLED` (default on); excluded from the MCP server, which
  stays REST/CLI-oriented.
- **Fix: mutating SQL admin statements failed through the prepared FlightSQL
  path.** `createPreparedStatement` advertised the generic DML/DDL `Count:
  int64` dataset schema for every claimed admin mutation (`CREATE ROLE`,
  `GRANT`, `CREATE USER`, ...), since they classify as DDL; ADBC/JDBC's strict
  prepare-time schema validation then rejected the real `(status, detail)`
  Execute result, so the dialect could not be driven through its primary
  clients at all. A claimed mutation now advertises the correct `(status,
  detail)` schema at Prepare, still without executing. Also unifies every
  mutation's result to exactly `(status, detail)`: `REVOKE`'s result no longer
  carries a separate `revoked` column - the count now lands in `detail` (e.g.
  `"revoked 2"`).
- **Revoking a personal access token now also kills its live statements.**
  `POST /api/auth/pat/revoke` (and `qod auth pat revoke`) still cascades the
  revocation over the token's whole minted subtree, and now additionally kills
  every in-flight statement issued with any of those tokens: synchronously on
  the replica serving the call, and on the other replicas of an HA cluster via
  a new `qod_pat_kill` LISTEN/NOTIFY channel (best-effort, typically
  milliseconds). Killed statements land in statement history with status
  `killed`; the `AuthPatRevoke` audit event gains `revokedCount` and
  `killedStatements` detail entries. BREAKING (wire shape): the revoke
  endpoint's 200 body was empty and is now
  `{"status":"ok","killedStatements":N}` where N counts the serving replica's
  kills. A failed kill or broadcast never fails the revoke: the tokens are
  already dead and running statements stay bounded by their statement
  timeouts.
- **Fix: a row/column policy predicate carrying a trailing SQL comment could
  silently disable RLS/CLS.** `RowPolicyRewriter` and `ColumnPolicyRewriter`
  splice a validated predicate/transform textually into generated SQL; a
  trailing `-- comment` (or a `/* */` block comment, or a bare `;`) commented
  out the rewriter's own closing parenthesis at splice time, the re-parse
  threw, and the statement was forwarded unfiltered. `RowPredicateValidator`
  and `TransformSqlValidator` now reject any `predicateSql`/`transformSql`
  containing a comment marker or a bare `;` outside string literals at
  create/update time (BEHAVIOR CHANGE: such values now fail policy
  create/update where they previously succeeded and silently broke
  filtering). For rows already stored before this fix, `RowPolicyRewriter`
  gains a `Failed` outcome: a predicate that cannot be applied at rewrite
  time now denies the statement (fail-closed) instead of forwarding it
  unfiltered.

## 0.7.2

- **Security: six SQL-authorization bypasses closed after a deep code review.**
  A whole-codebase review found and this release fixes, each with pinning
  tests: (1) a WITH-prefixed INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE could launder a read
  of any table through a CTE named after a granted table - the ACL parser now
  walks statement-level WITH clauses; (2) the row-level-security rewriter
  passed DuckDB `FROM t` shorthand, parenthesized joins, and every
  expression-position subquery (EXISTS / IN / scalar / HAVING) through
  unfiltered - the walk is now depth-complete; (3) WITH-prefixed DML and
  `EXPLAIN ANALYZE <dml>` were classified as reads, skipping the
  protected-write guard, RLS/CLS rewriting, write audit, and writer routing -
  the classifier now resolves the statement's real verb; (4) lockdown pools
  admitted local-file replacement scans through dollar-quoted (`$$...$$`) and
  escape-string (`e'...'`) literals in FROM position - both now deny unless
  provably remote; (5) the login endpoint distinguished "User not found" from
  "Invalid password" in both message and timing, an account-enumeration oracle
  that also enabled targeted lockout denial-of-service - the two failures are
  now indistinguishable on the wire, and raw JDBC error text no longer reaches
  unauthenticated callers; (6) a tenant admin who pointed their tenant's OIDC
  at an IdP they control could mint a token carrying the seeded superuser's
  username and obtain an unrestricted data-plane session bypassing ACL,
  RLS/CLS, and lockdown - a credential validated in a tenant realm can no
  longer bind to a superuser row. Multi-tenant deployments should upgrade.
  Module authors: `PoolSupervisor.authorizeHandshake` gained a defaulted
  parameter (source-compatible, binary-incompatible) - recompile modules
  against this core.

- **SCIM 2.0 provisioning.** `/api/scim/v2/{tenant}` serves RFC 7643/7644
  Users and Groups over the RBAC store for IdP connectors (Okta, Entra):
  CRUD, `eq` filters, pagination, PATCH (active toggle, member ops), and the
  discovery endpoints. `Authorization: Bearer` (static key or PAT) is accepted
  on the SCIM prefix only. The superuser realm is invisible to SCIM.

- **Idle hibernation in core.** A leader-gated sweep
  (`quack-on-demand.hibernation`, `QOD_HIBERNATE_*`) suspends a pool that has
  served no statements for its idle window, with per-pool opt-in via
  `Pool.idleTimeoutSec` (or a manager-wide `defaultIdleMinutes`). Inert on a
  fresh install; the FlightSQL edge still wakes a suspended pool on the first
  statement.

- **Scoped personal access tokens.** A PAT can now carry a restriction
  (pools, statement kinds, row caps, timeout) that attenuates the owner's
  effective set without ever widening it; tokens record their parent chain
  and revocation cascades to children. `qod pat create` grows the matching
  scope flags, the profile UI shows the full scope on hover, and audit
  records resolve PAT bearers to their owning principal.

- **Lockdown pools also deny resource settings.** `SET`/`RESET`/`PRAGMA` on
  `memory_limit`, `max_memory`, `threads`, `worker_threads`, and
  `max_temp_directory_size` are refused for non-superusers on lockdown pools,
  closing a resource-abuse vector (raising memory past the node's spawn-time
  default). Known limitation: the name match is statement-wide, so a
  statement that merely mentions a protected name (a table named `threads`,
  a literal containing `memory_limit`) is over-denied on lockdown pools.

- **RLS: quoted table identifiers no longer bypass row policies.** jsqlparser
  keeps double quotes on quoted identifiers, and the policy match compared
  the quoted form - Power BI-style folded SQL (`"tpch1"."customer"`) escaped
  its row policies entirely (fail-open). Matching now unquotes; the rewritten
  SQL keeps the caller's original quoting.

- **Docs moved to starlake-docs.** The standalone website is retired; the
  README now leads with the zero-commitment demo command.

## 0.7.1

- **Fixed `qod start` printing nothing (0.7.0 regression).** The supervised
  launcher introduced in 0.7.0 relays the manager's output through a pipe, and
  it read that pipe with `read(4096)`, which blocks until 4 KB has accumulated.
  The manager's startup banner is a few hundred bytes, so it stayed buffered
  while the manager sat there serving normally: `uvx qod start` looked hung on a
  blank screen even though `http://localhost:20900` was up. The relay now uses
  `read1`, which hands over whatever has arrived, so output appears as the
  manager emits it. `scripts/run-jar.sh` was never affected (it relays through
  `cat`). Affects 0.7.0 only.

## 0.7.0

- **`qod start` no longer fails when offline.** The manager jar is resolved from
  GitHub Releases on every run, so a machine with no network (a plane, a locked-down
  VPN, `uvx qod start` on a fresh shell) used to hard-fail even with a perfectly
  good jar in the cache. The release lookup now falls back to a cached jar: the
  release this CLI build pins when that one is cached, otherwise the newest cached
  version, naming what it picked and where the cache is. `--version latest` takes
  the same path instead of surfacing a raw connection traceback. An explicit
  `--version X.Y.Z` is still never substituted; when it is neither cached nor
  downloadable the error now lists the versions that are cached. An empty cache
  with no network remains an error. Cache locations (`~/Library/Caches/qod/jars`
  on macOS, `~/.cache/qod/jars` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\qod\Cache\jars` on
  Windows, `JAR_CACHE_DIR` to override) are now documented in the install guide.

## 0.6.9

- **Ctrl-C on a foreground launcher now acts as `qod stop`.** Both `qod start`
  (incl. `--demo`) and `scripts/run-jar.sh` supervise the manager JVM instead of
  exec-ing it: Ctrl-C (and `kill`/a closed terminal) triggers the graceful
  teardown - SIGTERM manager + nodes, bounded wait (`FORCE_AFTER`, default 10s),
  SIGKILL sweep - so an interrupted run no longer orphans duckdb node processes
  on ports 21900+. This also fixes a long-standing "Ctrl-C does nothing" bug:
  the JVM tree could flip the terminal into raw mode during boot (ISIG off),
  after which Ctrl-C stopped generating SIGINT entirely; the launchers now route
  the JVM's stdio through pipes so it never holds a terminal fd. The exit code
  is the JVM's own on a normal exit, 130 after an interrupt teardown. Windows
  (`run-jar.ps1` / `qod start` on win32) keeps the previous behavior.

- **Personal access tokens can be deleted.** A revoked or expired PAT stays in
  the listing until its owner discards it: `POST /api/auth/pat/delete`,
  `qod pat delete --id <id>`, or the profile page's Delete button (shown on dead
  rows where live rows show Revoke). Only dead tokens are deletable - a live id
  is refused `400 pat_live` (revoke remains the sole kill switch), and someone
  else's or an unknown id answers `404 not_found` with no existence leak, same
  contract as revoke. Deletion is audited as `auth.pat.delete` and rides the
  same self-scoped session-only surface (and non-admin profile allowlist) as
  the other PAT verbs.

- **Admin UI ergonomics.** The login screen refills the Tenant field from the
  last successful sign-in (stored client-side, saved only on success); the
  tenant filter comboboxes (Usage, Statements, Control Plane, Nodes, Catalog,
  Users) preselect the tenant the session signed in with - deep-link `?tenant=`
  still wins and a system-scope login keeps today's defaults; and the tenant
  detail page's tab order is now Databases, Pools, Maintenance, Auth provider.

- **Metrics for the metadata-filter and protected-write steps.** The FlightSQL
  pipeline now records `metadata_filter_rewrites_total{outcome}` /
  `metadata_filter_duration_seconds` and `protected_write_checks_total{outcome}` /
  `protected_write_check_duration_seconds` (per tenant/pool), so operators can see
  how often statements are filtered or denied by those steps and their latency,
  matching the existing column/row-policy rewrite metrics.

- **Closed a column/row-security bypass (S1).** A user restricted by a column mask
  or row policy could previously launder the unmasked/unfiltered data by wrapping
  the read in a write (`CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`, `INSERT ... SELECT`,
  `CREATE VIEW ... AS SELECT`, and via subqueries in `MERGE`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`),
  because masking/filtering only ran for plain `SELECT`. Such statements are now
  denied when their read side exposes a protected table: any read of a row-policy
  table, and a masked-column read of a CLS table (a write that reads only unmasked
  columns is still allowed, detected by running the write's inner SELECT through the
  real column-policy rewriter; any read the guard cannot isolate fails closed).
  Enforced whenever CLS/RLS enforcement is enabled (independent of `acl.enabled`,
  like the CLS/RLS rewriters themselves); superusers are unaffected.
  Closing this required making the read extractor complete-by-construction, which
  also tightens table-level ACL: a table read previously hidden from the grant check
  inside an `INSERT ... VALUES` subquery, a VALUES-derived FROM table, an expression
  wrapper (`ANY(ARRAY[...])`, `COLLATE`, and the like), or a Select-clause subquery
  (`GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT ON`, `QUALIFY`, named `WINDOW`, `GROUPING SETS`) is now
  grant-checked, so a principal without `RO` on such a table now gets a deny where
  the read used to slip through. Known limitation: a masked column referenced only in
  a `JOIN ON` condition of a write's read side is not detected (an inference-only
  channel, matching the base CLS SELECT path), and write-side row enforcement
  (scoping a policy-holder's own `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on a row-policy table to their
  rows) is a separate open follow-up, not part of this fix.

- **Filtered metadata.** Any authenticated principal can read the session database's
  `information_schema` (schemata/tables/columns/views) without a grant; result rows are
  filtered to the objects the principal holds at least RO on, so table-level ACL stays
  meaningful (no enumeration of ungranted objects). This also fixes catalog browsing in
  JDBC/ADBC clients: the FlightSQL catalog RPCs (`GetCatalogs` / `GetDbSchemas` /
  `GetTables`, the DBeaver and ADBC table-tree path) run as `information_schema` queries
  under the hood and so came back DENIED for any principal without an explicit grant;
  they now return the grant-scoped tree. Explicit `information_schema` grants keep
  today's unfiltered read; `QOD_ACL_FILTERED_METADATA=false` restores the old
  grant-required posture. Also closed: `DESCRIBE <t>` / `SHOW <t>` / `SHOW COLUMNS FROM
  <t>` previously bypassed the ACL entirely and now require RO on the target (applies
  whenever ACL is on, independent of the new flag); plain `SHOW TABLES` answers the
  filtered listing, and its `FROM`/`IN`/`LIKE` variants are denied while the filter is
  active (query `information_schema.tables` instead). `SHOW ALL TABLES` is unchanged
  (already denied under ACL). The filter is fail-closed: an `information_schema`
  reference in a position it cannot rewrite (ORDER BY, GROUP BY, a window clause) or a
  filterable name merely mentioned in a string literal is denied rather than passed
  through unfiltered.

- **Admin user lock.** The edit-user panel (and `qod user update --no-enabled` / the
  `enabled` field on `user/update`) can lock any account: sign-in is refused, tokens
  stop working, and only an admin can unlock. A superuser may lock any user, a tenant
  admin only their own tenant's users; locking yourself and locking the last enabled
  superuser are refused, and `user/delete` now carries the same two guards, so a
  deployment can never lock or delete itself out entirely. Note: a manager restart
  re-creates a DELETED seeded admin but does NOT unlock a LOCKED one; recovery from a
  lock is another admin, the static API key, or SQL. Any lock/unlock write also resets
  the account-lockout counters, like every other admin write to a user row.

## 0.6.6

_Released 2026-08-18._

- **BREAKING: an unset or empty `QOD_API_KEY` no longer leaves `/api` open.** Every
  non-public `/api` call now requires a session, a personal access token, or the static key;
  a keyless call answers 401 regardless of configuration. Keyless dev scripts must log in via
  `/api/auth/login` (or set `QOD_API_KEY`). Public endpoints (login, password reset, client
  config) are unaffected.
- **MCP server for AI agents.** The manager now serves an MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  endpoint at `POST /mcp` on the REST port (stateless Streamable HTTP, `QOD_MCP_ENABLED`
  default on), so agents like Claude Code can discover schemas, run SQL with full
  RBAC/RLS/CLS enforcement, use DuckLake time travel, and (with an admin credential)
  operate pools and nodes. Data tier: `run_sql` (row-capped via `QOD_MCP_MAX_ROWS`,
  default 500), `list_databases`, `list_tables`, `describe_table`, `table_history`,
  `list_snapshots`, `my_usage`. Admin tier: pool status/scale/suspend/resume, node
  restart/quarantine, active statements + kill, maintenance, tag create/protect
  (protect-only), audit search. Destructive and credential operations are deny-listed
  with no code path from `/mcp`. Auth is a personal access token or the static API key;
  session JWTs are refused.
- **Personal access tokens (PATs).** Long-lived bearer credentials for agents and
  scripts, minted from the profile page (UI), `qod auth pat create|list|revoke` (CLI),
  or `POST /api/auth/pat/*` (REST). Only a SHA-256 hash is stored; the token is shown
  once at mint. A PAT is accepted wherever a session token is, on both `/api` and
  `/mcp`, with exactly its owner's scope (admin PATs manage; `role=user` PATs are
  profile-only). PAT management itself is session-only: a PAT can never mint,
  enumerate, or revoke tokens.

## 0.6.5

_Released 2026-08-17._

- **Security (please upgrade): federated secrets with an external reference are now
  superuser-only.** A federated secret whose `externalRef` uses `env:` / `aws-sm:` /
  `gcp-sm:` / `azure-kv:` / `vault:` is resolved from the MANAGER's own trust domain at node
  spawn (`env:` reads the manager process environment; the KMS prefixes use its ambient
  credentials) and the resolved value is inlined into the tenant's node setup SQL, which the
  tenant can read back. A tenant admin could therefore author `env:QOD_SESSION_JWT_SECRET` on
  their own database, read it out of a node table, and forge a superuser session. Authoring an
  `externalRef` secret over REST/CLI now requires a superuser session
  (`403 superuser_required`); tenant admins keep value-backed (inline) secrets, and
  operator-run bootstrap / manifest imports (already superuser-gated) are unaffected. All
  0.6.x releases carry this; upgrade if tenant admins can manage federation.
- **Pool lifecycle actions moved to the pool detail page.** Scale, a Suspend menu
  (Hibernate / Drain / Kill), and Delete now live in the pool detail header instead of the
  tenant Pools list, which drops its Actions column. Scale keeps its Force option when
  shrinking; Hibernate suspends to zero nodes and auto-wakes on the next query.
- **CLI default profile.** `qod` now remembers a sticky default profile and adds a profiles
  listing, so repeated commands no longer need the connection flags spelled out each time.
- **Lockdown denies direct access to DuckLake buckets.** With node lockdown on, object-store
  access is denied at bucket granularity: the derived deny-set covers each tenant-db's
  DuckLake buckets plus the managed bucket, closing direct bucket reads that prefix rules
  alone did not.
- **Fixes.** The assembly bundles Jakarta Mail's registry files, so SMTP send no longer fails
  on a missing provider registry; the boot sequence defers the mutation-gate read until after
  modules start; `run-jar.sh` sources an untracked `.env.local` for local overrides.
- Project status is now marked Stable (was Beta), and the docs note opt-in active-active HA
  on Kubernetes.

## 0.6.4

- **Account lockout (opt-in).** After a configurable number of failed logins a database
  account locks. `QOD_AUTH_LOCKOUT_ENABLED` (default off) turns it on and
  `QOD_AUTH_LOCKOUT_MAX_FAILURES` (default 10) sets the threshold; enabling it requires an
  SMTP server to be configured (the manager refuses to boot otherwise, naming
  `QOD_SMTP_HOST`). Only users that carry an email are ever locked, so a user with a
  non-email username and no email is never affected. Enforced across REST login, the
  FlightSQL handshake, and the change-password endpoint; a locked login answers
  `401 account_locked`. Lockout does not revoke already-issued sessions.
- **Self-service password reset over email.** New public `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`
  and `POST /api/auth/reset-password` (also `qod auth forgot-password` / `reset-password`)
  let a user reset their own password through a single-use, time-limited link emailed to
  their address. Configure SMTP with `QOD_SMTP_HOST` / `_PORT` / `_USER` / `_PASSWORD` /
  `_FROM` / `_STARTTLS`, and `QOD_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` for the link's origin. The admin UI gains
  a "Forgot password?" link and a reset page. This is the recovery path for a locked
  account.
- **Optional email on database users.** `qodstate_user` gains an `email` column, settable on
  `user/create` and `user/update` (`qod user --email`, admin UI field). When a username is
  itself in email format, it IS the user's email (auto-assigned and immutable); setting a
  different email returns `400 invalid_email`. Existing email-format usernames are backfilled.
- **Operator notes.** Enabling lockout requires `QOD_SMTP_HOST` and `QOD_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
  A locked superuser recovers by restarting the manager (the admin re-seed clears the lock
  and resets to `QOD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) or via the static `X-API-Key`; set `QOD_ADMIN_USERNAME`
  to a real deliverable address if you want the seeded admin to self-recover by email.

## 0.6.3

- **Security (please upgrade): unauthenticated control-plane bypass fixed.** The REST
  API-key guard matched the raw percent-encoded request path while the router matched the
  decoded one, so a spelling like `GET /%61pi/tenant/list` or `GET ////api/tenant/list`
  (four or more leading slashes) skipped the guard entirely and still reached control-plane
  read AND write endpoints without a key or session. All 0.5.x and 0.6.0-0.6.2 releases
  carry this hole when `QOD_API_KEY` is set. The guard now derives its path from the same
  decoded segments the router uses (leading empties dropped), with regression tests pinning
  both spellings. Deployments exposed beyond localhost should upgrade.
- **Forced password change at next login.** A super or tenant admin can flag a user's
  password as temporary at create or reset time (`mustChangePassword` on `user/create` and
  `user/update`, `--must-change-password` in the CLI, a checkbox in the admin UI). Until the
  user changes it, both the REST login (`401 password_change_required`) and the FlightSQL
  handshake refuse it. A new public pre-session `POST /api/auth/change-password` (also
  `qod auth change-password`) lets the user set a real password: current password is the
  credential, the new one must differ. The database auth queries now MUST project a fourth
  `must_change_password` column - a shorter custom `QOD_AUTH_DB_SYSTEM_QUERY` /
  `QOD_AUTH_DB_TENANT_QUERY` fails at boot with an actionable error.
- **Regular users can sign in to a profile page.** A tenant-scoped `role=user` login now
  mints a profile-only session instead of being refused: the admin console stays admin-only,
  but regular users land on a Profile page where they can change their own password and view
  their own usage and recent statements (`qod profile usage` / `qod profile statements`).
  Non-admin sessions are demoted at the API guard to an exact allowlist (whoami, logout,
  the two profile endpoints); every other endpoint answers `403 admin_required`, and those
  denials are now audited. The system (tenant-less) login and OIDC SSO remain admin-only.

## 0.6.2

- **DuckDB driver + node engine alignment.** duckdb_jdbc bumped 1.5.5.0 to 1.5.5.1
  (driver-only patch: auto-close of the getResultSet result; engine stays 1.5.5). The
  K8s node image now bakes DuckDB CLI 1.5.5 (it had lagged at 1.5.4 through the 1.5.5
  cycle) and the pin-parity spec guards the Dockerfile so a future engine bump that
  misses the node image fails the suite.
- **Node image released in lockstep.** Every release now publishes
  `starlakeai/quack-on-demand-node:<version>` (plus minor/major/latest tags) alongside
  the manager image, built from the release tag. Before this, the node image only ever
  had -SNAPSHOT tags; 0.6.1's node tag was minted retroactively from the
  benchmark-validated snapshot digest. The Helm chart docs now recommend pinning the
  release tag; the default stays latest-snapshot.

## 0.6.1

- **K8s registry-drift hardening.** The pod set and the `qodstate_node` registry now converge
  instead of wedging when they drift (node-group replacement, crash mid-teardown, pool
  delete/recreate): teardown stops are best-effort (a dead pod or apiserver error can no
  longer block row cleanup; the warn names the possibly-leaked pod), reconcile gets real k8s
  liveness via one labeled pod-list per pool (missing pods respawn up to the pool's
  distribution; DEAD rows beyond that distribution are pruned every tick, while a live-pod
  overage is left alone and only logged as a warn - an HA replica with a stale, lagging
  distribution must never stop and delete healthy pods), and `pool/delete` and manifest
  imports sweep DB-side node rows before the pool row (FK RESTRICT kept as the last-line
  invariant). `KubernetesQuackBackend.stop` waits for actual pod deletion (new
  `k8s.stopTimeoutSec` / `QOD_K8S_STOP_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 60) while `start` retries a
  create that 409s against a Terminating twin, no longer tears down a pre-existing incumbent's
  Service/Secrets on a failed start (the incumbent's token-Secret value is restored too, so
  manager-restart adoption keeps authenticating), and creates the per-node Service idempotently (an
  out-of-band pod death can leave the Service behind; a respawn on the same node id updates it
  in place instead of 409ing). `database/update` rolls now report per-node failures instead of
  aborting with a bodyless 500, and `node/restart` maps backend errors to a structured 502. The
  federation Secret is GC'd even when the pool's last pod is already gone.

## 0.6.0

- **Cache-aware query routing (directory-lite).** Repeat queries over the same tables stick to
  the node that already holds their data on object-store pools, with a load cap bounding skew.
  Each table gets up to three warm "homes" (spread by overflow, invalidated by write epochs);
  routing picks the warmest eligible node and falls back to least-loaded everywhere else.
  New config: routing.cacheAware (QOD_ROUTING_CACHE_AWARE, default true),
  routing.loadCapFactor (QOD_ROUTING_LOAD_CAP_FACTOR, default 2.0). New metrics:
  routing_tables_total, routing_placements_total, routing_decisions_total, routing_load_ratio.
  Setting cacheAware=false instantly reverts routing decisions to least-loaded; the locality
  metrics and their memoized statement parse keep running (they are the milestone-1 baseline
  and are deliberately ungated). Pinned statements (transaction pin or soft preferredNode) are
  labeled pinned-sticky/pinned-move in routing_decisions_total, keeping the overflow-evict-home
  build trigger clean; HA followers clear placement state on peer-driven pool deletes.
- **Docs: HA is documented as supported.** operating/resilience.md now describes the opt-in
  Kubernetes HA mode (advisory-lock singleton duties, per-pool locks, LISTEN/NOTIFY cache
  propagation) instead of calling two managers unsafe, and lists the routing caches among the
  per-manager in-memory state rebuilt from traffic.
- **Two deployment-shaped Grafana dashboards.** grafana-dashboard.json is replaced by
  grafana-dashboard-single.json (one-box docker-compose stack) and grafana-dashboard-k8s.json
  (multi-node / Kubernetes, adds pool occupancy, node health, and the new routing locality row).
  Both gain DuckLake maintenance and CLS/RLS rewrite panels that were never dashboarded before.

## 0.5.3

- **Per-pool node lockdown override.** `qodstate_pool` gains a tri-state
  `lockdown` (`inherit | on | off`, default inherit = the global
  `QOD_NODE_LOCKDOWN` flag), resolved once per pool and enforced by BOTH
  layers (edge screen per statement, engine SQL at node spawn). Superuser-only
  `POST /api/pool/setLockdown` persists the override and restarts the pool's
  nodes; `pool/create` takes a `lockdown` field (superuser-gated when not
  `inherit`) surfaced as `qod pool create --lockdown` and a pool-detail UI
  toggle; manifests export/import the override (and now `suspended` too).
- **libquackwire is vendored in-repo; Maven Central publication retired.**
  The native JNI binaries for all five platforms live in git under
  `libquackwire/binaries/` (with sha256 companions and a VERSION stamp) and
  are packaged straight into the assembly - no classifier jars, no Sonatype,
  no GPG. `scripts/refresh-quackwire-binaries.sh` rebuilds the host platform
  and pulls the rest from CI; releases verify the vendored set instead of
  querying Central. `QOD_WITH_WINDOWS_NATIVE` is retired: `quackwire.dll` is
  bundled automatically whenever it is vendored (it currently is).
- **Tag-driven release workflow; CI is the sole publisher.** Pushing a
  `v<X.Y.Z>` tag cuts the full release from GitHub Actions (jar + sha256,
  GitHub release, PyPI `qod` + `qod-cli` with a version-drift guard,
  multi-arch Docker, Discord announce, next-snapshot bump PR).
  `scripts/release.sh` now only verifies, stamps the release versions, tags,
  and pushes; `release-jar.sh` is retired and `release-docker.sh` is a manual
  fallback.
- **Per-database object-store credentials take effect at runtime.** A tenant-db's
  `objectStore` map now authors a DuckDB secret scoped to that database's
  `dataPath` at node spawn, so each database authenticates its own bucket with
  its own keys alongside the process-global `QOD_S3_*`/`QOD_AZURE_*`/`QOD_GCS_*`
  defaults (DuckDB picks the most specific scope). On Kubernetes the resolved
  SQL lands in a per-node Secret injected via `secretKeyRef`, never inlined in
  the pod spec; REST responses redact the secret keys; semicolons are rejected
  in credential values; editing `objectStore` restarts the database's nodes so
  rotation applies immediately.
- **Operator security hardening.** `QOD_NODE_LOCKDOWN=true` adds a two-layer
  lockdown (edge denial of ATTACH/INSTALL/protected SET/local-file read
  functions for tenant sessions + engine value-sets before `quack_serve`);
  spawned K8s node pods get non-root / seccomp / read-only-rootfs security
  defaults; an opt-in helm NetworkPolicy (default-deny node + manager
  policies); and cached catalog readers are evicted after idle to bound
  Postgres connections. See the new operator hardening guide.
- **DuckDB upgraded 1.5.4 -> 1.5.5** across every pinned layer: libquackwire
  rebuilt against libduckdb 1.5.5 (`1.5.5-7e80f7ffcc98-1`, duckdb-quack
  submodule at the v1.5-variegata head - brings fetch-batch pushdown fixes,
  catalog fetch truncation fix, INSERT RETURNING rejection, and secret-sourced
  quack_serve tokens), the DuckDB JDBC driver (`1.5.5.0`), and the runtime
  libduckdb / DuckDB CLI fetched by `run-jar.sh` / `run-jar.ps1` and the
  `qod` Python CLI.
- **quackwire macOS CI now links the official libduckdb release zip** instead
  of Homebrew (whose bottle lags DuckDB releases).
- **`QOD_VERSION=BUILD` links the local libquackwire rebuild against the
  pinned libduckdb** from the `.duckdb/<version>` cache (staging the internal
  header tree once per version) instead of the operator's system install.
- **CLI-bundled spawn scripts re-synced** with the canonical ones (they were
  missing the per-db object-store and lockdown blocks, so `qod start` nodes
  silently lacked both).
- **Pin-bump checklist partially automated**: engine verb renames, sched-join
  drift, and launcher-pin drift now fail the suite instead of silently
  misclassifying history.

## 0.5.2

- **`ManagerContext.sessionOf`** module SPI hook for portal-style modules
  (resolve the session behind a request without re-implementing cookie/token
  parsing).
- **`qod start` fixed on Windows.**

(Released 2026-07-20 without a changelog section; reconstructed retroactively.)

## 0.5.1

### Module SPI: mutation gates

- **Modules can now veto resource growth.** The manager module SPI gains
  `MutationGate`: a module contributes gates via
  `ManagerModule.mutationGates`, and the supervisor consults them before
  `createTenantDb`, `createPool`, and pool scaling. A refusing gate surfaces
  as HTTP 429 with code `quota_exceeded` and the gate's reason string in the
  body, so hosted-service modules can enforce per-tenant structure quotas
  (max databases, max pools, max nodes per pool) without any policy living in
  core. Zero-module boots are unchanged: no gates, no new behavior.
- **Operators always pass.** Superuser sessions and static-key callers bypass
  gates entirely, so a broken or overly strict quota policy can never lock
  operators out of provisioning. A gate that throws refuses the mutation
  (fail closed): a broken policy store must not grant unlimited resources.
- **Session scope for modules.** `ManagerContext` gains `scopeOf`, the same
  session-token-to-scope resolver core handlers use for tenant scoping, so
  modules can gate their own endpoints with the manager's session semantics
  instead of reinventing auth.

## 0.5.0

### Scale to zero

- **Pools can now hibernate.** `qodstate_pool.suspended` marks a pool scaled to
  zero WITH its role distribution kept: suspend gracefully drains every node
  (in-flight statements finish) while the DuckLake catalog and data stay
  intact, and the stored distribution is the memory of what to respawn. Wake is
  automatic: the first FlightSQL statement against a suspended pool resumes it
  and the edge holds the query until a node is routable, bounded by
  `PROXY_RESUME_HOLD_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 60s), then fails retryable ("pool is
  resuming, retry shortly"). No client changes needed; the first query after a
  sleep just looks slow once.
- **Suspend on demand.** `POST /api/pool/suspend` / `POST /api/pool/resume`
  (tenant-scoped, audited as `pool.suspend` / `pool.resume`), a Hibernated
  badge plus Suspend/Wake button in the UI, and `startSuspended` on pool
  create: provision a pool with its catalog initialized but zero nodes until
  first use.
- **Guard rails.** Scaling a suspended pool is rejected with 409
  `pool_suspended` (resume first); stopping a suspended pool zeroes the
  distribution and clears the flag so it genuinely stays down; `disabled`
  still wins over everything and is never auto-woken.
- **Self-healing.** Reconcile skips suspended pools' respawn, heals a crash
  mid-suspend by draining straggler nodes, refreshes pool state under the
  per-pool lock so it can never drain a pool that woke mid-pass, and a failed
  resume is retried by the next reconcile pass. Suspend/resume serialize
  through per-pool advisory locks and propagate across HA replicas.
- **Module events.** `PoolSuspended` / `PoolResumed` manager events (reason
  `rest | query | module`) for hosted-service modules building idle policies
  on the SPI.

### CLI

- **Full REST parity, permanently enforced.** Every manager REST operation is
  now reachable from `qod` with every parameter, and a parity gate keeps it
  that way: the OpenAPI document generated from the endpoint definitions is
  committed as a contract copy (`cli/tests/resources/openapi.yaml`, pinned to
  the code by a build-time freshness check), and the CLI test suite fails
  whenever an operation or parameter lacks a command. Browser-redirect
  endpoints (OIDC / SQL-token flows) are the only exclusions, each justified
  in the test.
- **New commands from the catch-up:** `qod pool suspend`, `qod pool resume`,
  `qod pool status`, `qod catalog tags`, `qod ready`, `--start-suspended` and
  repeatable `--cohort w,r,d` on `qod pool create`, and `--tenant` on
  `qod auth mode`.

### Logging

- **Quiet by default.** One knob, `QOD_LOG_LEVEL` (env var or `-D` system
  property), now drives the whole process and defaults to `ERROR`: a plain
  `qod start` boots silently. Set `QOD_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` for the operational
  boot log (ports, module loads, reconcile) or `DEBUG` for application
  internals; the grpc/netty/Arrow firehoses stay clamped at WARN so DEBUG
  remains usable. Security misconfiguration reports (open REST API without
  `QOD_API_KEY`, dev-default `QOD_SESSION_JWT_SECRET`) are logged at ERROR so
  they survive the quiet default.

- **Operator boot banner.** The manager always prints (stdout, regardless of
  log level) the control-plane Postgres URL it is about to use, refuses to
  start with a clear message when that Postgres is unreachable, and once both
  listeners are up prints a copy-pasteable banner with the REST/UI URL, the
  FlightSQL endpoint, and ready-made JDBC, ADBC, and ODBC connection strings.

### Fixes

- The bundled demo loader script (`_load-common.sh`) is re-synced with the
  canonical copy shipped in `scripts/`.
- Malformed `--cohort` values now fail with a clean usage error instead of a
  traceback.

## 0.4.5

### Distribution

- **The native client degrades gracefully where no libquackwire is bundled.**
  On platforms with no native binary for the running JVM (Windows on ARM64:
  `quackwire.dll` is x86_64-only), the manager now logs a warning and falls
  back to the embedded HTTP client instead of crashing at JNI load. Setting
  `QOD_NATIVE_CLIENT=false` by hand on ARM Windows is no longer needed.

### Catalog

- **Restore / rollback to a snapshot (Spec 04).** `POST /api/catalog/restore` rolls a live
  table back to a prior snapshot (id or tag) as a new forward snapshot: history is preserved
  and the pre-restore state stays queryable. Dry-run returns the exact change summary that
  will be undone; `expectedCurrentSnapshot` turns a concurrent write into a 409 instead of a
  silent overwrite. Surfaced as a Restore action in the snapshot browser and the table
  history timeline, and as `qod catalog restore`. Requires an ALL grant, or DDL plus RO/RW,
  on the table. Time-travel `AT (VERSION => n)` clauses are now stripped before ACL parsing,
  so grant-holding (non-superuser) principals can run time-travel statements at all surfaces.

---

## 0.4.4

### Distribution

- **`qod` installs on Windows on ARM.** `adbc-driver-flightsql` and `pyarrow`
  ship no Windows ARM64 wheels, and their sdist builds fail, which broke
  `uvx qod` entirely on that platform. The dependencies are now skipped there
  via environment markers; the launcher, REST commands, and `qod start
  --demo` are unaffected, and `qod sql` explains the limitation instead of
  crashing.

---

## 0.4.3

### Distribution

- **Windows on ARM: DuckDB provisioning works.** The launcher now maps
  `(win32, arm64)` to DuckDB's native `windows-arm64` CLI and libduckdb
  assets; previously `qod start` on ARM Windows (e.g. Parallels on Apple
  Silicon) failed with "could not provision the duckdb CLI". Note the native
  `quackwire.dll` remains x86_64-only: set `QOD_NATIVE_CLIENT=false` for
  `qod start` on ARM Windows (the demo already forces it).

---

## 0.4.2

### Distribution

- **TLS cert auto-generation no longer requires `openssl`.** The edge now
  generates its self-signed certificate with the JRE's own `keytool` (present
  in every runtime the manager boots on), extracting the key in-process, so
  `qod start` and `qod start --demo` work on stock Windows where `openssl` is
  not on PATH. `openssl` remains as a fallback for JREs without keytool.

---

## 0.4.1

### Release tooling

- **The manager is no longer published to Maven Central.** GitHub Releases is
  the canonical jar channel (sha256-verified by the qod launcher); PyPI and
  Docker Hub are unchanged. libquackwire stays on Maven Central since it is a
  build-time dependency that must resolve anonymously.
- **libquackwire no longer version-bumps on every manager release.** Its
  version now only moves when its inputs change (the DuckDB pin or the native
  source); between changes build.sbt keeps pinning the last released coord,
  and the CI snapshot publisher fails fast if a native change lands without a
  version bump.

---

## 0.4.0

### Distribution

- **BREAKING: `qod demo` is now `qod start --demo`.** The demo is a flag on
  `start` instead of a separate subcommand; behavior is unchanged (embedded
  ephemeral Postgres, seeded TPC-H, RLS/CLS showcase, no external Postgres).
  The jar's `demo` subcommand is untouched, so `docker run ... demo` and
  `java -jar ... demo` work as before.
- **The demo banner prints when the manager is ready, not before boot.** It
  now lands at the end of the boot output with the admin UI logins and
  copy-pastable JDBC / ADBC / ODBC configurations for every seeded credential.
- **The Java runtime download no longer prompts.** When no Java 21+ is found,
  `qod start` announces the Temurin JRE download and proceeds; the now
  purposeless `--yes` / `-y` flag is removed.

---

## 0.3.10

### Distribution

- **`qod demo` / `qod start` now run the latest release by default.** The
  launcher resolves the newest GitHub release on every run instead of pinning
  the jar to the CLI's own version. When the lookup fails (offline), it falls
  back to the manager release stamped into the CLI build from `version.sbt`,
  so a cached jar still boots without network. `--version X.Y.Z` or
  `QOD_VERSION` pin a release as before.

### Release tooling

- The Discord release announce warns instead of failing when CHANGELOG.md has
  no section for the version, posting the repo and release-notes links only.
- Fixed a multi-platform Docker release race: the amd64 and arm64 builds no
  longer share one `node_modules` cache mount (concurrent `npm ci` runs could
  fail with ENOTEMPTY).

---

## 0.3.9

### Security

- **`qod demo` now serves FlightSQL over TLS.** The demo edge keeps TLS on with a
  self-signed certificate auto-generated under the ephemeral demo home (wiped on
  exit). The banner advertises `grpc+tls://` and the connect snippets carry the
  skip-verify knob (`tls_skip_verify` for ADBC, `disableCertificateVerification`
  for JDBC).

### Logging

- **Quiet by default.** Application logs now default to INFO instead of DEBUG.
  Set `QOD_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` (env var or `-D` system property) to get debug logs
  back when diagnosing.

### Documentation

- The self-contained demo moved to the top of the Quickstart, now with the admin
  console logins and ready-to-paste JDBC / ADBC / ODBC connection strings for
  every seeded user. The native `qod start` path is presented before Docker
  Compose.

---

## 0.3.8

### Distribution

- **One-command evaluation: `uvx qod demo`.** The Python CLI is now the launcher: it downloads
  the release jar from GitHub Releases (verified against the new `.sha256` release asset),
  auto-provisions a cached Temurin 21 JRE when no Java 21+ is present, self-installs the
  ABI-pinned DuckDB (CLI + libduckdb), bundles the node spawn scripts, and execs the jar with
  the right flags. Works the same on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **`qod demo` (jar subcommand).** A fully self-contained demo: embedded ephemeral Postgres,
  seeded minimal TPC-H, row/column security showcase (analyst sees masked `c_phone` and
  BUILDING-segment rows only), all state deleted on Ctrl-C.
- **`qod start` / `qod stop`.** Run a real manager against your own Postgres with no checkout,
  at env-var parity with `scripts/run-jar.sh`: `QOD_VERSION`, `JAVA_BIN`, `JAVA_OPTS`,
  `JAR_CACHE_DIR`, `DUCKDB_VERSION`, `DUCKDB_CACHE_DIR`, the `LOAD_TPCH` / `LOAD_TPCDS` /
  `LOAD_SSB` / `LOAD_TPC` background seeders, `DEMO=full|minimal`, and `NUKE=1`. `qod stop`
  discovers by port and tears down manager + nodes (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL).
- **PyPI package renamed to `qod`** (`pip install qod`); `qod-cli` remains as a compatibility
  alias. `scripts/install.sh` offers a curl-to-shell bootstrap (installs uv, then qod).

### Security

- **Row-level and column-level security are no longer experimental and are enabled by default.**
  `quack-on-demand.cls.enabled` and `quack-on-demand.rls.enabled` now default to `true`;
  `QOD_CLS_ENABLED=false` / `QOD_RLS_ENABLED=false` remain available as kill switches.
  With no policies defined the rewriters still short-circuit per statement, so deployments
  without column or row policies see no behavior change.

## 0.3.7

### Catalog

- **Per-table history / audit timeline (EPIC Spec 01).** `GET /api/catalog/tenant/{tenant}/database/{tenantDb}/schemas/{schema}/tables/{table}/history`
  returns the table's DuckLake commit history, newest first, with operation classification
  (create / insert / delete / update / alter / drop / maintenance / unknown), author and commit
  message (P1 stamping), a schema-changed flag, and row/file deltas attributable to the table.
  Keyset pagination (`limit` default 50 max 200, `before`) plus server-side `from` / `to` /
  `operation` / `author` filters. Identity keys on the stable DuckLake `table_id`, so history
  survives renames. New History tab on the catalog table detail page: a filterable timeline,
  a per-commit detail drawer, and deep links to "view table at this snapshot" (AS OF) and
  "compare schema" (two-snapshot diff). Null authors (pre-stamping snapshots) render as
  "unknown". History reads audit as `catalog.history.read` under the existing
  `QOD_AUDIT_CATALOG_READS` knob.
- **Time-travel viewer completed (EPIC Spec 00).** The snapshot browser now shows the author and
  commit message stamped on each snapshot (unstamped rows render "unknown") and can filter the
  timeline to one table. Tables can be viewed as of a timestamp (`asOfTs=<ISO-8601>`, resolved
  nearest-at-or-before and surfaced in the response) in addition to snapshot ids and tags. A new
  row preview (`GET .../tables/{t}/preview`) executes through the same FlightSQL pipeline as data
  traffic: pool ACLs, row-level and column-level policies all apply, reads route only to
  ReadOnly/Dual nodes, and every preview is audited. A two-snapshot schema diff
  (`GET .../tables/{t}/schema-diff?from=&to=`, ids or tag names) reports added, removed, retyped,
  and renullabled columns, rename-proof via table identity. Expired snapshots now return 410 and
  beyond-latest ids 422. The catalog browser endpoints are session-gated (closing the last
  endpoint-signature drift), with optional full read auditing via `QOD_AUDIT_CATALOG_READS`.

### Governance

- **Named and protected snapshot tags with reference pinning (EPIC P2 / Spec 06).** Any DuckLake
  snapshot can carry human-readable tags (`pre-migration`, `2026-Q2-release`) scoped per tenant-db,
  managed from the snapshot browser (chips, create modal, retention-hold toggle, pinned summary) or
  via gated REST endpoints (`POST /api/catalog/tag/create|delete|protect`,
  `GET /api/catalog/tenant/{tenant}/database/{tenantDb}/tags`). A `protected` tag pins its snapshot
  and every referenced file: the new `PinnedSetResolver` is the pin-set the managed-maintenance
  service will consult before expiring anything. The catalog table view accepts `asOfTag=<name>`
  wherever `asOf=<id>` works (both at once is a 400; unknown or dangling tags 404). Tag mutations
  are tenant-scoped, audited (`tag.create`/`tag.delete`, and dedicated `tag.hold.create`/
  `tag.hold.remove` so removing a retention hold is distinctly visible), and tag names can never be
  all digits, so they stay unambiguous next to snapshot ids.

### Security

- **ACL two-part table names are now resolved engine-consistently (attached-catalog aware).**
  Under `QOD_ACL_ENABLED=true`, `schema.table` (e.g. `tpch1.customer`) now resolves against the
  session's default catalog and just works with a matching grant; previously the static validator
  guessed catalog-first and denied it. When the first part names a catalog that may actually be
  attached on the pool's nodes (the tenant-db itself, any federation alias including disabled
  ones, or the DuckDB built-ins `memory`/`system`/`temp`), the statement is denied as ambiguous
  with an actionable message to qualify fully as `catalog.schema.table` - the engine binds such
  names catalog-first, so guessing either way would let a broad in-tenant grant reach a federated
  source without its per-alias grant. Qualification errors in general now fail closed instead of
  silently dropping the offending table from the access set. Operational note: after DELETING a
  federated source, recycle the pool - running nodes keep the catalog attached while the
  ambiguity guard no longer covers it.
- **Manager restarts no longer degrade the session schema context.** `PoolSupervisor` restore now
  preserves each tenant-db's default database/schema when rehydrating pool state, so ACL
  qualification and the RLS/CLS rewriters keep resolving unqualified names correctly after a
  redeploy instead of falling back to `main`.

### Operations

- **"Run maintenance now" works.** Manual and scheduled maintenance runs previously failed
  instantly with `flush: Permanent(java.net.ConnectException)`: the runner sent the chain's first
  statement to the ephemeral maintenance node milliseconds after fork, seconds before its DuckDB
  was listening. The spawn path now gates on TCP readiness with a bounded wait
  (`maintenance.nodeReadyTimeoutSec`, env `QOD_MAINT_NODE_READY_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 180 to cover
  cold extension installs). The Maintenance panel also gained structured controls: a Refresh
  button on Run history, a scope select (whole database / single table with schema+table inputs),
  and per-operation checkboxes replacing the free-text CSV.
- **Single-instance profile: `DEMO=minimal`.** All three launchers (`run-jar.sh`, `run-jar.ps1`,
  `run-docker-compose.sh`) accept `DEMO=full|minimal` (default `full`). `minimal` bootstraps the
  shape for fronting a single DuckDB instance: one tenant (acme), one pool, one dual node serving
  both reads and writes, from the new bundled `bootstrap-demo-minimal.yaml` (analyst RLS/CLS demo
  included): `NUKE=1 DEMO=minimal LOAD_TPCH=1 ./scripts/run-jar.sh`. Use `full` for the
  multi-tenant, multi-pool, federation demo. The profile is only consulted when a `LOAD_*` flag is
  set and `QOD_BOOTSTRAP_YAML` is unset; bootstrap only imports into a fresh control plane, so
  switch profiles with `NUKE=1`. `DEMO=minimal` with `LOAD_TPCDS` warns and skips the loader (no
  globex tenant in this profile).
- **Managed DuckLake maintenance: auto-compaction, snapshot expiry, cleanup (EPIC Spec 09).**
  A policy-driven background service keeps every DuckLake tenant-db healthy and storage bounded:
  a leader-gated scheduler triggers runs on small-file thresholds and a per-lake cadence
  (default daily 03:00 UTC, staggered), and each run executes the full DuckLake chain (flush,
  expiry, compaction, delete-rewrite, cleanup with a grace window, orphan deletion) on an
  ephemeral dedicated node, never on serving nodes. Retention holds are enforced: expiry always
  uses explicit snapshot versions minus the P2 pin-set, and a fail-safe guard skips cleanup if a
  pinned file ever appears in the deletion schedule. Policies are hierarchical
  (table > schema > tenant-db; retention default 7 days = the time-travel horizon) via
  `POST /api/maintenance/policy/upsert`; run history is the audit trail
  (`GET /api/maintenance/runs`, `maintenance.run` audit entries with bytes reclaimed) and a
  manual `POST /api/maintenance/run` remains as an escape hatch. New Maintenance tab on the
  tenant page; `qod_maint_*` Prometheus metrics; `QOD_MAINT_*` knobs. The
  Postgres-external-catalog cleanup landmine is pinned by an integration test that proves files
  are physically deleted (and that compaction alone reclaims nothing).

### Audit

- **FlightSQL writes stamp DuckLake snapshots with the authenticated principal (EPIC P1).** Every
  INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / DDL routed through the FlightSQL edge now sets `author =
  tenant:<tenant>/user:<user>` and `commit_message = flightsql <verb>` on the DuckLake snapshot it
  creates. The bracket is a three-PREPARE sequence on one wire connection so the exact DML row count
  is preserved. Stamping is fail-open: a prelude failure lands the write unstamped rather than
  blocking it. Knob: `quack-on-demand.stampWrites` / `QOD_STAMP_WRITES` (default on, native client
  path only). Pre-existing snapshots keep `author: null` (rendered "unknown" in the UI).

## 0.3.6

### Catalog snapshots and time travel

- **DuckLake snapshot browser with AS OF views.** The catalog browser (the standalone `/ui/catalog` page and the inline browser opened from a tenant's Databases tab) gains a per-database **Snapshots** panel: snapshot id, commit time, raw change summary, computed rows and files added or removed, and the affected tables resolved to names, newest first with keyset pagination (`limit` default 200 clamped to 1..1000, `before` cursor; "Load older snapshots" in the UI). New `GET /api/catalog/tenant/{tenant}/database/{tenantDb}/snapshots`; the table endpoint gains an optional `?asOf=<snapshot id>` that re-renders the summary, column list, and parquet files as of that snapshot, and the table detail page gets a snapshot picker, an AS OF banner, and a back-to-current action with the choice encoded in the URL. Visibility predicates match DuckDB's `AT (VERSION => n)` semantics (verified against the engine, including flushed inlined DML whose files are backdated to the logical snapshot); the AS OF row count is computed as data-file rows minus delete-file rows, so it can briefly differ from the stats-based current count on unflushed inlined rows. Unknown snapshot ids and tables that did not yet exist at the snapshot return 404. Like the rest of the catalog browser these are metadata-only Postgres reads: no Quack node round trip, and they work with zero running nodes.

### Admin UI

- **Statements/Usage chart polish and race fixes.** Recharts upgraded to v3. Statements page: a range or filter change now supersedes an in-flight load-more instead of being silently skipped, load-more pages stay inside the window the first page used, and a failed fetch clears stale charts and rows instead of leaving them under the error banner. Usage page: same stale-data clearing, no redundant fetch when switching to a custom range before both dates are picked, and the chart's aggregate bucket is labeled "(other)" so it cannot collide with a tenant named other.
- **pool/list tenant filter fixed for display names.** Tenant admins of a tenant whose display name differs from its id (the demo's own `acme` / "Acme Corporation" included) previously got an empty `/api/pool/list`, which also blanked the pool selects on the Statements and Usage pages. The filter now compares tenant ids.
- **Audit nav dropdown.** The Audit, History, and Usage tabs are grouped under a single "Audit" dropdown menu named Control Plane, Statements, and Usage; page headings follow. Paths are unchanged (`/audit`, `/history`, `/usage`).
- **Admin UI guide refreshed.** `website/docs/operating/admin-ui.md` now covers the full current UI (running-statements kill, quarantine/restart, database edit form, pool scale modal and resource limits, connections recipes, catalog table detail, RBAC scopes, config filter and manifest import flow) with regenerated screenshots.

### Usage and accounting

- **Per-tenant / per-pool / per-user metering with export.** `GET /api/usage` aggregates the daily rollup ledger over a period (defaults to the current calendar month, UTC) grouped by tenant, pool, or user; each group carries totals (`statements`, `errors`, `denied`, `engineMs`) plus per-day sub-totals. New "Usage" admin UI page: month or custom-range picker, stacked per-day bar chart (statements or engine-ms), totals table, client-side CSV export (`tenant,pool,user,statements,errors,denied,engine_ms`). Daily rollups are now retained for `QOD_USAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 400) and purged by the hourly duty. Tenant admins are pinned to their tenant; the JSON API is the integration surface for external billing.

### Audit log

- **Audit filter selects and no-tenant filter.** `GET /api/audit/list` gains `noTenant=true` (superuser: only rows with no tenant scope). BREAKING for API callers: a superuser `?tenant=` filter now returns only that tenant's rows; null-tenant rows are no longer mixed in. New `GET /api/audit/actions` serves the exhaustive action vocabulary from a central registry; the Audit page's tenant and action filters are now selects (tenant options from `/api/tenant/list`, plus a "(no tenant)" option).

- **Persisted, tenant-scoped audit trail.** `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=postgres` (the default) records control-plane mutations, auth events (`auth.login`, `auth.login.failure`, `auth.logout`, `auth.revoke`, `auth.api-key.failure`), data-plane ACL denials (`sql.denied`), and data-plane writes (`sql.write`, `sql.ddl`) into a new `qodstate_audit` table. The action taxonomy covers all mutating handlers across tenant, database, pool, user, role, group, membership, node, federation, and manifest surfaces. Detail fields are sanitization-guaranteed at construction time: keys matching `password`, `secret`, `token`, `jwt`, or `credential` are rejected before any write reaches the store. `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` disables all recording, skips the journal fiber, purge, and rollup duties, and hides the Audit UI page. `GET /api/audit/list` (filters: family, tenant, actor, action, q, from, to, limit up to 500, keyset `before` cursor) is tenant-scoped: superusers see all rows including null-tenant ones; tenant admins see only their tenant. An hourly purge enforces `QOD_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90). The `EventJournal` routes data-plane events through a bounded async queue (capacity 8192); queue overflow or append failure increments `qod_journal_dropped_total{table}` without blocking the statement hot path. A new **Audit** page in the admin UI (superusers and tenant admins; hidden when telemetry is off) surfaces a filter bar (family toggle, tenant, actor, action, time range), a newest-first table with expandable detail, and keyset load-more pagination.

### Statement history and trends

- **Persisted, tenant-scoped statement history with trend rollups.** `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=postgres` (the default) records every FlightSQL statement (including reads, unlike the audit log) into a new `qodstate_stmt_history` table; SQL text is capped at 500 characters. `PREPARE` probe statements are excluded: the matching `EXECUTE` row carries a `prepareMs` field instead. A background rollup job (watermark-based, idempotent, leader-gated in HA mode) aggregates raw rows into a new `qodstate_stmt_rollup` table on a configurable interval (`QOD_ROLLUP_INTERVAL_SEC`, default 300s, with a 60s skew buffer). Hourly rollups (per `tenant+pool`, `percentile_cont` p50/p95/p99, retained for `QOD_HOURLY_ROLLUP_RETENTION_DAYS` default 90) power trend charts; daily rollups (per `tenant+pool+username`, null percentiles) accumulate for the upcoming per-user usage feature whose retention knob ships with it. An outage shorter than the raw retention window (`QOD_STMT_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 7) recomputes cleanly on the next tick; a longer outage permanently loses the truncated rollup range. Raw retention must stay at or above 2 days because the daily recompute rebuilds the watermark's full day. `GET /api/history/statements` (filters: tenant, pool, user, status, q, from, to, limit up to 500, keyset `before` cursor) and `GET /api/history/trends` (granularity: hour or day; tenant, pool, from, to) are both tenant-scoped: superusers see everything, tenant admins see only their tenant. A new **History** page in the admin UI (superusers and tenant admins; hidden when telemetry is off) shows a range picker, three charts (statement volume, latency percentiles on hourly granularity, error rate), and a searchable statement table with keyset load-more pagination. `qod_journal_dropped_total{table="stmt_history"}` counts missed statement rows, which translate directly to undercounted rollup buckets. `QOD_TELEMETRY_STORE=none` disables all recording and hides the History page.

### High availability (opt-in, Kubernetes only)

- **Active-active manager replicas with zero-downtime rollout.** `QOD_HA_ENABLED=true` (helm: `replicaCount > 1`) runs N managers, all serving REST + FlightSQL. One replica holds a Postgres session advisory lock (`HaCoordinator`) and runs the singleton duties (reconcile respawns, bootstrap, DuckLake init, revoked-jti purge); leader duties re-run on promotion. Pool mutations serialize across replicas via per-pool advisory locks (`PoolLocker`); caches propagate via LISTEN/NOTIFY on `qod_topology` / `qod_rbac` / `qod_revocation` (published from every `PoolSupervisor` mutator and manifest import) with a periodic snapshot-refresh fallback and a deletion-aware `restore()`. JWT revocations persist in the new `qodstate_revoked_jti` table (Liquibase changelog `0014`) so a session revoked on one replica is denied on all. `/health` stays liveness-only (503 when Postgres is unreachable); new `/ready` gates readiness on Postgres. Helm wires the env flag, requires a pinned session JWT secret, sets `RollingUpdate maxUnavailable: 0`, adds a PodDisruptionBudget, and couples termination grace to `drainTimeoutSec`. HA off (default) preserves single-manager behavior; HA with the local backend is refused at config load. Documented in the RESILIENCE guide with a kind failover check.

### Security - whole-codebase audit 2026-07-02

The full report lives at `docs/security-audit-2026-07-02.md`; the findings below are fixed.

- **Node-bootstrap SQL injection closed.** `TenantDb.validate` rejects injection metacharacters in `schemaName`, `dbName`, `dataPath`, and the `pg*` connection params (denylist on `pgHost`/`pgUser`/`pgPassword`, numeric `pgPort`) at the control-plane trust boundary, covering both the local and Kubernetes backends; `spawn-quack-node.sh` also quotes SQL identifiers. Manifest import runs the injection-safety subset (`validateSafety`) so DuckLake tenant-dbs that legitimately omit keys merged from the default metastore still import.
- **ACL fails closed on parser blind spots.** `TableExtractor` now reports constructs it cannot map to a grantable table (table functions like `read_parquet`, string-literal file refs, unrecognized FROM-item / statement node types) as `unsupported` markers instead of silently dropping them, and `PostgresAclValidator` denies whenever any are present (unless the principal holds `*.*.*` ALL). Missing walker arms added (parenthesized joins, UPDATE SET-value subqueries, MERGE action subqueries, Json/Signed/Extract wrappers); CTE shadowing only suppresses unqualified names; `EXPLAIN ANALYZE <stmt>` is authorized as the inner statement it executes; `ControlFlow` is now an explicit allowlist so unknown statement types fall through to `ParseError`.
- **RLS/CLS parse failures deny.** `FlightSqlRouter` denies when `RowPolicyRewriter` / `ColumnPolicyRewriter` cannot parse a statement that has policies attached (a parse failure means filtering cannot be verified), and the transient-failure retry resends the fully rewritten (RLS-wrapped) SQL instead of the CLS-only intermediate.
- **Prepared statements peer-bound and re-authorized live.** A prepared-statement handle only executes for the peer that created it (a leaked handle replayed from another connection gets UNAUTHORIZED), and both Execute paths re-read the `EffectiveSet` from the live session at call time instead of replaying the Prepare-time snapshot - a grant revoked mid-session now takes effect on prepared statements exactly as it does on one-shot statements, and a handle whose session has expired resolves to a deny.
- **Cross-tenant RBAC privilege escalation closed.** `addUserRole` / `addUserGroup` / `addGroupRole` enforce that the referenced role/group shares the principal's tenant.
- **Cookie-authenticated sessions are now tenant/superuser-scoped on all
  REST endpoints.** Body-tenant, id-only, and read/superuser-gated endpoints
  previously enforced scope only for the X-API-Key header path; a browser
  session (HttpOnly qod_session cookie, no header) reached the handlers with
  no resolved identity and was admitted. This let a tenant admin mutate other
  tenants' pools, databases, and RBAC objects, reach superuser-only operations
  (manifest export/import, server config), and receive unfiltered cross-tenant
  reads from pool/tenant list and statement history. The worst case was
  manifest import: a cookie-authenticated tenant admin could overwrite the
  entire control plane. All such endpoints now resolve the session cookie into
  the scope check (header still takes precedence). Path/query-tenant endpoints
  were already covered by the perimeter guard.
- **Constant-time API-key compare.** `apiKeyGuard` compared `X-API-Key` with `String.equals`, leaking the key length-by-length via response timing; replaced with `MessageDigest.isEqual`.
- **Internal exception text no longer reaches Flight clients.** Every catch-all INTERNAL arm in `FlightProducerImpl` now logs the full detail server-side against a short random errorId and returns only `internal error (errorId=...)`; raw messages could carry SQL fragments, hostnames, and file paths. Curated `RouterFailure` messages still flow through unchanged.
- **K8s spawn-failure orphans cleaned up.** `start()` deletes the pod, service, and per-pod token Secret when a spawn fails partway, preventing orphan accumulation and a deterministic-nodeId respawn deadlock.

### Observability

- **DuckDB engine metrics per node.** The manager previously collected nothing from inside the DuckDB engine - every per-node signal was derived from wire round-trip latency, so memory pressure and spill-to-disk were invisible until they degraded latency. A new `EngineStats` scrape runs a single round-trip over `duckdb_memory()` and `duckdb_temporary_files()` through the existing `quack_query` wire (no node-side change), piggybacked on every successful health-probe tick; a failed scrape keeps the previous sample and can never flip a node unhealthy. Surfaced in three places: four Prometheus gauges tagged `(tenant, pool, node_id, role)` (`node_duckdb_memory_used_bytes`, `node_duckdb_temp_storage_bytes`, `node_duckdb_spill_files`, `node_duckdb_spill_bytes` - nodes never scraped publish no row rather than a false zero), new Mem / Spill columns plus fleet-total cards on the admin UI's Nodes page (`NodeInfo` gains the four fields), and a "DuckDB Engine" row in the bundled Grafana dashboard. Verified live against a TPC-H load: the buffer-manager gauge tracks query activity and REST, `/metrics`, and the UI agree. Two live-run fixes are folded in: the quack wire's schema-only first Arrow batch is skipped when decoding the scrape result, and `NodeInfo`'s hand-rolled circe codec now carries the new fields (a `NodeInfoCodecSpec` round-trip pins the shape so an added field can no longer silently vanish from `/api/pool/list`).

### Incident response

- **Incident response for administrators:** durable node quarantine/unquarantine (survives restarts, HA-propagated, probe-proof), superuser node restart via the reconcile respawn path, live in-flight statement view on the Nodes page, and best-effort statement kill (stream disconnect locally, qod_kill NOTIFY fan-out across HA replicas). New endpoints: POST /api/node/unquarantine, POST /api/node/restart, GET /api/node/active-statements, POST /api/statement/kill.

### Demo, scripts, and release

- **Releases are announced on Discord #news.** `release-jar.sh` posts the repo link plus the version's changelog section (chunked to Discord's message limit) via the new `scripts/announce-release-discord.sh` right after creating the GitHub release; webhook from `QOD_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` or the untracked `.env`, failures warn without failing the release.
- **SSB star schema seeded via `LOAD_SSB=N`** (bundled into the `LOAD_TPC` shortcut next to TPC-H and TPC-DS). DuckDB has no ssb extension, so `scripts/load-ssb-dbgen.sh` generates TPC-H in-memory and derives the 5 SSB tables (`lineorder`, `customer`, `supplier`, `part`, `dwdate`) per the O'Neil spec mapping; the date dimension is named `dwdate` so the 13 canonical queries run unquoted. Lands in schema `ssb1` of the existing `acme_tpch` tenant-db, wired into all three install paths.
- **kind local stack unbroken + loaders no longer OOM at SF >= 10.** The helm step died with `HELM_EXTRA_ARGS[@]: unbound variable` on bash 3.2 when no TPC seed was requested; the TPC loaders were OOM-killed at SF >= 10 because DuckDB's default memory budget ignores the cgroup limit - a cgroup-aware `memory_limit` (default 40% of the cgroup cap, `MEMORY_LIMIT`-overridable) makes it spill to disk instead.
- **Compose summary crash fixed.** The end-of-script summary still read the removed `_profile_set` array, so under `set -u` every `run-docker-compose.sh` run died after the stack was already up, losing the URL summary and the zero exit code.
- **Release: tag pushed before `gh release create`** (which requires the tag on the remote).

### Kubernetes node pods

- **Kubernetes node-pod sizing and templates.** Pools carry `cpu` and `memory`
  (each applied as request and limit on the quack container, Guaranteed QoS
  when both set) via `POST /api/pool/setResources` and sliders on the pool
  create form and pool detail page (CPU 0.5-128 cores, memory 1-1024 Gi).
  Behind `QOD_POD_TEMPLATE_ENABLED` (default off, superuser only), a pool may
  carry a full Pod-manifest template through `POST /api/pool/setPodTemplate`
  (API-only); the manager overlays the pod identity labels, the quack
  container's env contract, and resources onto it, so sidecars/volumes/affinity
  are expressible while adoption and routing keep working. Applies on next node
  spawn. The local backend ignores these (Kubernetes-only).
- **Manifest round-trips pod sizing and templates.** Manifest export/import now carries per-pool `cpu`, `memory`, and `podTemplateYaml`; previously they were dropped, so a backup/restore silently lost pod sizing and the pod template. Verbatim round-trip (non-secret operator config); the manifest is superuser-only.

### Database configuration

- **Per-database init SQL.** Tenant-dbs carry an `initSql` executed at node boot
  before the quack extension loads, ahead of the pool's own initSql and the
  federation blob, so operators set temp directory, memory limit, or extension
  loads once per database and pools can still override. Field on database create,
  the manifest, and the Databases UI.
  New endpoint POST /api/database/update edits any safe subset of a database
  (metastore, object store, default database/schema, init SQL; name, kind, and
  data path stay immutable) and restarts all the database's nodes when
  node-affecting fields change. The Databases UI opens the editor on name
  click, shows per-database table counts linking into the catalog browser,
  and reports the effective data path for databases inheriting the default.

## 0.3.5

### Connectivity and auth

- **Browser OAuth token page for JDBC / DBeaver.** New guard-exempt `/api/auth/sql-token` start + callback flow on the manager port: the browser is redirected to the edge OIDC provider (endpoints resolved via OIDC discovery, so split-horizon deployments work), logs in, and the callback renders the id token (aud = the edge client id) for pasting into DBeaver's token property. Retires the dormant standalone `:8888` OAuth broker - `OAuthHttpServer`, the `auth.oauth{}` config block, and the `QOD_AUTH_OAUTH_*` env vars are gone; a single `auth.oauthScopes` key remains. State token uses a constant-time HMAC compare. The kind rig's Keycloak realm enables the auth-code flow and derives the token's tenant claim from a per-user attribute instead of hardcoding one.
- **Multi-FETCH Arrow streams no longer corrupt.** `ChainedQuackArrowReader` swapped to a fresh child root on every FETCH round while the Flight stream kept flushing the first (closed) root, so any result spanning more than one PREPARE/FETCH round-trip surfaced client-side as `mismatch number of rows in column: got=0, want=N`. The reader now owns one stable `VectorSchemaRoot` and copies each child batch into it, restoring the ArrowReader contract.

### Pools and supervision

- **Drain / force stop scales the pool to 0 instead of deleting it.** The pool row survives and stays drained across manager restarts. Deletion is now a dedicated path: `POST /api/pool/delete` plus a Delete button in the UI.
- **Periodic reconcile.** `reconcile()` runs on a background fiber every `reconcileIntervalSec` (default 30s, env `QOD_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SEC`, `0` restores boot-only), so a node that dies while the manager is up is respawned on the next tick. Also fixes a node stuck in "draining" after drain + rescale: the stale `NodeLoadTracker` entry is reset before respawn and removed on drain/delete.

### Examples and docs

- **FlightSQL client examples in four languages** under `examples/`: TypeScript (raw gRPC + apache-arrow, since Node has no first-party driver), Python (ADBC), Java (Flight SQL JDBC), and Rust (arrow-flight over tonic). Each runs single queries and the 22 standard TPC-H queries against a live edge, sharing the `QOD_*` env-var contract. An n8n community node (catalog operations via FlightSQL) was added and then moved to its own repo, as was the Power BI connector.
- **Administration docs section**: onboarding golden paths, access-control, day-2 operations, lifecycle and config playbooks, an overview + task map, and a "Manage by manifest" page with YAML fragments aligned to each playbook. Corrections along the way: state lives in `qodstate_*` tables, the removed `/api/acl/grant` API replaced with real RBAC calls, required `tenantDb` added to pool curls.
- **Connecting guides** for DBeaver and Tableau; README repositioned around the DuckLake serving layer with an honest comparison table and a data-residency diagram; `.env.example` clarifies public vs internal ports.

### Build and release

- **`release.sh` split into resumable per-artifact phases**: a shared `release-lib.sh` plus `release-libquackwire.sh` (native jars to Maven Central), `release-jar.sh` (manager jar, tag, GitHub release), and `release-docker.sh` (multi-arch image), each idempotent so a mid-release failure is resumed by re-running the failed phase.
- **libquackwire CI publishes on manual `workflow_dispatch`** from main, enabling a snapshot re-publish without a code push.
- `run-jar.sh` keeps sbt/JLine from leaving the WSL pty in raw mode; the UI pool Delete button shows only the icon.

## 0.3.4

- **DuckDB upgraded 1.5.3 -> 1.5.4** across every pinned layer: the libquackwire native shim rebuilt against libduckdb 1.5.4 (`1.5.4-40de7badae41-1`, duckdb-quack submodule at the v1.5-variegata tip), the DuckDB JDBC driver (`1.5.4.0`), and the runtime libduckdb / DuckDB CLI fetched by the Dockerfiles and `run-jar.sh`.

## 0.3.3

### Security

- **Row-level security.** Per-role row policies - a boolean SQL predicate authored via REST, the admin UI's Role "Row policy" tab, or a YAML manifest - are enforced on every SELECT before it reaches a Quack node. The gateway rewrites the query to fold the policy predicate into the statement's WHERE so a role only ever sees the rows its predicate admits; superusers bypass, matching the table- and column-level ACLs. New `qodstate_role_row_policy` table (Liquibase changelog `0013`), `RoleRowPolicy` model, an `EffectiveSet` row-policy field, REST + effective-set + manifest plumbing, a demo policy seeded on `acme/analyst`, and an `adbc.sh` query helper to exercise it. Documented in the rbac-model guide.

### Admin-UI authentication (OIDC SSO)

- **OIDC single sign-on for the admin UI.** Provider-agnostic OpenID Connect discovery (Keycloak, Google, Azure, AWS) drives an authorize / callback / end-session flow protected by a signed state token and PKCE. New `OidcSsoService` plus `AuthHandlers.oidcStart/oidcCallback/oidcLogout` (system scope, superuser-only); `auth.management.publicBaseUrl` builds the redirect URIs; `/api/config/client` surfaces `identitySource` + `ssoProviderName` so the UI shows a pure-SSO login branch when `identitySource=oidc`. Open-redirect guard and PKCE-verifier round-trip are test-covered. The Helm chart gains admin-UI OIDC SSO config and a local-stack demo.
- **Per-tenant admin-UI login mode.** `GET /api/auth/mode` resolves the login mode (local password vs OIDC SSO) per tenant via `ManagementAuthModeResolver`; the UI queries it on the login screen so different tenants can present different flows. `mintSessionFor` keys grant derivation on the resolved per-scope mode, and `identitySource` is now a system-scope-only concept.
- **Keycloak split-horizon bearer validation.** A Keycloak issuer override lets a bearer minted against an internal issuer URL validate when discovery advertises a public one. FlightSQL identity now maps from `preferred_username` (not `sub`), and `x-qod-superuser` is accepted as an alias of the superuser flag.

### FlightSQL edge - Power BI / ODBC compatibility

- **Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC driver compatibility (Power BI).** Conformance fixes for the Arrow Flight SQL ODBC driver: `GetSchema` for query commands, `parameter_schema` set on Prepare results (empty = 0 params), `FlightSqlServerTransaction=NONE` instead of `TRANSACTION`, R7/R12 conformance, per-RPC auth on `DoGet`, `x-qod-authorization` accepted as an alias for `Authorization`, and `LIKE` (not `=`) for the catalog filter in `getStreamSchemas` / `getStreamTables`. Adds a Power BI connector install/connect guide, the signed `.pqx` + self-signed cert path, and per-provider OAuth (Azure / AWS / Google) docs.
- **Literal DML / DDL over FlightSQL.** `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` and DDL statements execute over the Flight SQL update path; the result advertises a `Count` schema so ADBC accepts the stream.

### Features

- **Per-pool `initSql`.** SQL set on a pool is prepended to the federation blob at node spawn (Liquibase changelog `0011`), so every node in the pool runs operator-supplied setup before serving queries.
- **Remote-access local stack.** `PUBLIC_HOST`, a NodePort on `31338`, and Power BI OAuth wiring let the kind-based local stack be reached from off-box clients.

### Fixes and internals

- **Tenant slug as the single key.** A tenant's slug id is now the one identity key, decoupled from its display name; fixtures and specs realigned.
- **Caches moved to Caffeine.** The RBAC effective-set cache and `GoogleGroupsLookup.groupsCache` migrated from `ConcurrentHashMap` to bounded Caffeine caches.
- **UI clears the prior tenant's data on tenant switch** in the Users screen.
- **`run-docker-compose.sh` made bash 3.2 compatible**; the truncated `scopes` value in the Helm `values-local-stack.yaml` fixed.
- **Release hardening.** `scripts/release.sh` now purges stray Metals Scala-CLI scratch dirs before building (a Scala 3.8 TASTy left under the source tree broke `Compile / doc` during `publishSigned`) and builds the Docker image from the `v<version>` tag rather than the post-release `-SNAPSHOT` working tree.
- Node distribution display uses the user name instead of the node position.

## 0.3.2

### Security

- **RBAC tenant scope on every handler.** Every endpoint in `/api/{user,role,group,membership,pool/permission}/*` now checks the calling session's `manageableTenants` before mutating. Tenant-A admin sessions get `403 tenant_forbidden` on tenant-B resources; missing ids return `404` (no cross-tenant existence leak).
- **Statement-history cross-tenant leak fixed.** `GET /api/node/statements` filters the ring buffer by the session's manageable tenants. Allow-set covers both surrogate id and display-name forms so the filter survives the FlightSQL router recording in either shape.
- **JWT session cookies.** `SessionTokenStore` is now a stateless HS256 JWT signer/verifier; login also sets `qod_session=<jwt>` as `HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Lax`. Sessions survive manager restart when `QOD_SESSION_JWT_SECRET` is pinned, enabling horizontal scale-out. The UI drops the localStorage token path entirely - browsers use the cookie; CLI clients still use `X-API-Key`.
- **Cloud secret resolvers gated.** `secretStore = aws-sm | gcp-sm | azure-kv | vault` is refused at config load (resolvers are stubs). Under `dispatch` mode the stubs stay wired so postgres+env deployments work; the runtime error names the prefix and the supported alternatives. UI dropdown options for stub stores are disabled.
- **FederationBlobBuilder SQL-quote-safe.** Every resolved secret value and the expanded alias are doubled (`'` → `''`) before splicing into the operator template. Apostrophes in passwords no longer break the `ATTACH`.
- **DuckLake ATTACH escape hardened.** Postgres calls in `DuckLakeInitializer` switched to `PreparedStatement` binds; the DuckLake connstring uses a two-layer escape (`libpqValue` inside `duckdbLiteral`) so the bearer password can contain any character.
- **Full 128-bit ids.** Every surrogate id is now `<prefix>-<32 hex>` (`Names.newSurrogateId`) instead of `<prefix>-<8 hex>` (~77K-row collision). Legacy 8-char ids in existing rows continue to match.
- **K8s federation works.** Per-pool `qod-fedsql-${tenant}-${tenantDb}-${pool}` Secret carries `extraSetupSql`; pods reference it via `env.valueFrom.secretKeyRef`. `kubectl describe pod` never shows the credential; etcd doesn't either.
- **K8s node tokens persist across restart.** Per-pod `qod-token-${nodeId}` Secret carries the bearer; `discoverExisting` reads it back, so adopted pods don't 401 on manager restart.
- **REST stubs removed.** `POST /api/node/setRole` and `POST /api/node/restart` were stubs that lied about persisting state. Use `POST /api/pool/scale` or `POST /api/node/quarantine` instead.
- **K8s ServiceAccount can manage Secrets.** The chart's `Role` was granting `pods` + `services` but omitting `secrets`, so `KubernetesQuackBackend.ensureTokenSecret` (mandatory pre-pod step) failed with `403 forbidden` and the manager `CrashLoopBackOff`-ed on every fresh helm install.
- **`whoami` error codes differentiated.** A failed lookup used to surface as `{"error":"expired"}` for six different conditions (no token, malformed JWT, signature mismatch from a rotated secret, missing jti, exp past, jti revoked). New `SessionTokenStore.LookupResult` ADT maps each cause to a distinct response code (`no_session` / `invalid` / `expired` / `revoked`), so operators reading the network tab can tell "secret rotated on helm upgrade" apart from "session timed out".
- **Cookie `Secure` flag auto-derives from request scheme.** `sessionCookieSecure` defaults to `auto` (was `true`): the handler reads `X-Forwarded-Proto` per request - `https` → `Secure`, `http`/absent → not `Secure`. `run-jar.sh` on plaintext HTTP no longer drops the `Set-Cookie` response, while helm behind a TLS-terminating ingress keeps `Secure=true` automatically. `QOD_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true|false` still forces either value for misconfigured proxies that strip the header.
- **Column-level security.** Per-role, per-column policies (action: `deny` or `mask`) authored via REST, admin UI, or YAML manifest. The gateway rewrites SELECTs before they reach a Quack node: every covered column reference (in projection, WHERE, HAVING, subqueries, CTE bodies, UNION arms) is replaced with the operator-authored transform expression; `SELECT *` is expanded against the DuckLake column catalog and masked in place; a `deny` match short-circuits the query with a 403-style error. Transform SQL is strict-containment-validated at write time (must be one scalar expression referencing only the protected column; subqueries, denylisted functions like `read_parquet`, `attach`, `pragma_*`, and references to other columns are rejected). Superusers bypass, matching the existing table-level ACL. New `qodstate_role_column_policy` table; new `EffectiveSet.columnPolicies` field; three Micrometer metrics (`column_policy_rewrites_total`, `column_policy_catalog_lookups_total`, `column_policy_rewrite_duration_seconds`); ~25 new tests across `TransformSqlValidatorSpec`, `ColumnPolicyRewriterSpec`, `RoleColumnPolicyStoreSpec`, `RoleColumnPolicyHandlersSpec`, `ManifestColumnPolicyRoundTripSpec`; new admin UI tab "Column policies" on the Role detail page; manifest YAML round-trip with example policy seeded in `bootstrap-demo.yaml`.

### Performance

- **HikariCP on the control-plane store.** `PostgresControlPlaneStore` and `UserStore` use HikariCP (sizes 20 and 10). Handshake path went from 5 fresh TCP+TLS+auth handshakes per request to 5 borrow-from-idle.
- **EffectiveSet cache.** 60s TTL `ConcurrentHashMap` keyed by `(userId, jwtRolesHash, jwtGroupsHash)`; invalidated from every RBAC mutator + `restore()`. Collapses N FlightSQL handshakes for the same user into 1.
- **Manifest export/import.** Single `store.snapshot()` + name→entity index maps replaced N+1 list calls per tenant/user/role.
- **`unsafeRunSync` in `PoolSupervisor.createPool`** removed (proper `flatMap` composition).
- **K8s `waitReady`** switched from a `Thread.sleep(500)` busy-poll to fabric8's `waitUntilCondition` watch - ~120 fewer API-server calls per 60s pod startup.
- **`DuckLakeCatalogReader` evicted** on tenant-db delete: the per-tenant-db Hikari pool is closed promptly. Stale-credential foot-gun closed.
- **Sessions auto-expire.** Initial sliding-window idle TTL on `SessionTokenStore` (superseded by the stateless JWT exp).
- **FlightSQL Prepare cheaper + co-located with Execute.** ADBC `cur.execute()` was hitting the backend twice (Prepare ran the full SQL to read the result schema, Execute ran it again to stream rows), routed independently so the two halves could land on different nodes. Prepare now classifies the SQL through `PrepareStrategy`: DML/DDL skip the node entirely (also fixing a latent double-INSERT hazard), wrappable SELECTs send a `LIMIT-0` subquery probe whose schema feeds `dataset_schema` in milliseconds, and the rest fall back to today's path. The Execute then soft-pins to the node that served Prepare so DuckDB's per-process caches stay warm.
- **Prepare + Execute merged into one UI history row.** The `LIMIT-0` probe no longer records a separate row; the matching Execute carries the probe duration as `prepareDurationMs` and the UI renders it as subtext (`57 ms / prep 28 ms`) under the Execute duration.

### Demo, loaders, and bare-jar UX

- **`LOAD_TPC=N` split into `LOAD_TPCH=N` + `LOAD_TPCDS=N`.** Each benchmark is now opt-in at its own scale factor across `run-jar.sh`, `run-docker-compose.sh`, and the kind-based `run-local-stack-k8s.sh`. `LOAD_TPC=N` stays as a legacy shortcut for both (explicit per-bench vars override it). The Compose + k8s launchers also stop pre-creating Postgres databases that won't be seeded. Fixes a real k8s bug where the chart README already advertised `LOAD_TPCH=1` but the launcher script only honored `LOAD_TPC`, so users following the README got nothing seeded.
- **TPC-DS workload in the bundled load tester.** `tpch-load-test.py` gains `--workload tpcds` (or `LT_WORKLOAD=tpcds`); the runner cycles 7 curated queries (Q3, Q7, Q19, Q42, Q52, Q55, Q98) covering per-group aggregation, multi-way joins, top-N, and a window function. Default schema auto-picks `tpcds1` to match `scripts/load-tpcds-dbgen.sh`. The existing TPC-H mix stays the default.
- **DuckDB CLI + `libduckdb` self-installed by `run-jar.sh`.** First boot fetches both into `$REPO_DIR/.duckdb/<version>/{bin,lib}` at the ABI libquackwire links against (pinned via `DUCKDB_VERSION`, relocatable via `DUCKDB_CACHE_DIR`), prepends them to `$PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` / `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and skips re-downloads on subsequent runs. Mandatory by design: a system duckdb at the wrong ABI crashes the first node spawn with a confusing `UnsatisfiedLinkError`. Air-gapped operators pre-populate the cache directory and the fast path takes over.
- **Loader temp-spill fixed for SF >= 10.** `load-tpch-dbgen.sh` and `load-tpcds-dbgen.sh` now anchor `temp_directory` to an absolute `.tmp/duckdb-{tpch,tpcds}-load/` they pre-create, so DuckDB's spill-to-disk during `dbgen` / `dsdgen` actually lands somewhere writable. Previously the call aborted with `IO Error: Cannot open file ".tmp/duckdb_temp_storage_DEFAULT-1.tmp"` and every subsequent `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT FROM memory.main.<t>` failed because the source tables were never populated.
- **Release script attaches a GitHub Release.** `scripts/release.sh` now calls `gh release create v$version --generate-notes` against the tag sbt-release pushed, so the assembly jar lands on the GitHub Releases page alongside the Maven Central artifact.
- **Smoke test rewritten for the live demo bootstrap.** `test-api.sh` was creating a pool under tenant `tpch` (which never existed in the demo bootstrap) and missing the `tenantDb` field added when the pool key became `(tenant, tenantDb, pool)`. It now creates a `smoke` pool under `acme/acme_tpch` (cleaned up at the end), and tolerates 409 on tenant + pool creation so re-runs are safe.

### Cleanup

- **File-state mode dropped** (~250 LOC + ~80 LOC tests): `PostgresStateStore`, `StateStore`/`FileStateStore`, `StoredState`, `StoredPool`, `StoredTenant`. The `stateStorage` / `statePath` config knobs and all 5 `Main.scala` guards are gone. Postgres is the only control-plane store.
- **`ManifestIdentity` + `FederationImportSummary`** dropped (defined, never read).
- **`DbAdmin.dropDatabase` non-FORCE fallback** dropped (PG16 floor - always supported).

## 0.3.1

- Per-pool node placement (cohorts) - a pool can now be defined as a
  list of cohorts. Operators can express
  layouts such as "2 writers on nodes tagged `disktype=ssd` and 1 reader
  + 1 writer on nodes tagged `disktype=hdd`" against a single pool.
- JDK floor raised to 21.
