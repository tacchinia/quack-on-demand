# Delegating data-access authorization to Open Policy Agent

QoD can hand the data-access decisions of a tenant to that tenant's own
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) server. QoD stays the enforcement point; the
tenant's Rego policy is the source of truth for:

1. **pool access**, decided once at session handshake (the `connect` rule), and
2. **table access**, decided once per statement for every table the statement touches (the
   `statement` rule).

Row filters and column masks are not decided by OPA in this version (see "Result" below).

## Modes

Each tenant is in exactly one mode:

| Mode | Pool access | Table access |
|---|---|---|
| `qod` | QoD pool grants (`qodstate_pool_permission`) | QoD role permissions (`qodstate_role_permission`) |
| `opa` | the tenant's OPA, `connect` rule | the tenant's OPA, `statement` rule |

On an `opa` tenant QoD's grant tables are ignored. Role and group **memberships** still resolve
(QoD RBAC graph plus JWT/OIDC claim names) and are sent to OPA as identity attributes. OPA
authorizes; it does not create users: users of an `opa` tenant are provisioned as usual (SCIM,
OIDC, CLI, REST).

`opa` mode always validates statements, even when the manager-wide `QOD_ACL_ENABLED` is false: a
policy you configured is never silently ignored by a global flag. Any stored mode other than exactly
`qod` is treated as `opa` (fail closed).

Superusers (users with no tenant) never reach OPA, in either mode.

## Configuration

### Manager-wide (environment)

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `QOD_ACL_MODE` | `qod` | Mode of a tenant that sets none. |
| `QOD_OPA_URL` | empty | OPA base URL for `opa` tenants that set none (an operator-run sidecar). |
| `QOD_OPA_TIMEOUT_MS` | `2000` | Bound on one whole OPA exchange (connect, headers and body). |
| `QOD_OPA_CACHE_TTL_SEC` | `5` | Seconds an allow / deny is cached. `0` disables the cache. |

### Per tenant

```bash
qod tenant set-acl acme --mode opa --opa-url https://opa.acme.internal:8181 \
    --opa-policy-path qod/authz --opa-token "$OPA_TOKEN"
qod tenant set-acl acme --send-statement-text      # include the SQL text in the input
qod tenant set-acl acme --mode qod                 # back to QoD grants
```

- Omitted options keep their stored value; an empty string clears one (`--mode ''` = manager
  default, `--opa-url ''` = fall back to `QOD_OPA_URL`, `--opa-token ''` = no token).
- `--opa-policy-path` defaults to `qod/authz`; it is slash-separated identifiers only.
- Switching a tenant to `opa` with neither a tenant URL nor `QOD_OPA_URL` is refused
  (`400 opa_url_required`).
- The token is write-only: sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, never returned (responses only
  say whether one is set), redacted in exported manifests.
- The same settings are available in the admin UI (tenant page, Access control section) and the
  MCP admin tool `set_tenant_acl`.

**Manifest re-import.** An exported manifest carries the token redacted. Re-importing it onto a
tenant that still has a stored token keeps that token. Importing it where no token is stored (a
fresh control plane) is an import error, not a silent drop: supply the real value in the manifest,
or import without `opaToken` and set it afterwards with `qod tenant set-acl`.

## The contract

QoD calls `POST {opaUrl}/v1/data/{policyPath}/connect` and
`POST {opaUrl}/v1/data/{policyPath}/statement`.

### connect input

```json
{"input": {
  "kind": "connect",
  "tenant": "acme",
  "database": "tpch",
  "pool": "bi",
  "parentPool": null,
  "user": {"name": "alice", "roles": ["analyst"], "groups": ["emea"], "claims": {"dept": "fin"}},
  "client": {"edge": "flightsql"}
}}
```

- `pool` is the addressed pool. For a branch pool (`__br_<id8>`) `parentPool` is an array of the
  parent database's pool names, so a policy can let a branch inherit access from its parent; it is
  `null` for a regular pool.
- `roles` and `groups` are the resolved closure, sorted. `claims` are the verified token claims
  when the session was authenticated by a token, `{}` otherwise.
- `client.edge` is `flightsql`, `quack` (native Quack front door), `mcp` (MCP tools and the REST
  SQL preview), `rest` (the read-only REST data edge, and the branch creation access probe) or
  `dry-run` (`qod tenant opa-test`).

### statement input

```json
{"input": {
  "kind": "statement",
  "tenant": "acme",
  "database": "tpch",
  "pool": "bi",
  "parentPool": null,
  "user": {"name": "alice", "roles": ["analyst"], "groups": ["emea"], "claims": {"dept": "fin"}},
  "client": {"edge": "mcp"},
  "statement": {"class": "WRITE"},
  "accesses": [
    {"catalog": "tpch", "schema": "main", "table": "lineitem", "verb": "write"},
    {"catalog": "tpch", "schema": "main", "table": "orders", "verb": "read"}
  ]
}}
```

- `statement.class` is `READ`, `WRITE` or `DDL`.
- `accesses` is the exact table set QoD's SQL parser extracts (the same parser and catalog
  qualification as QoD's own grant check), fully qualified, sorted, deduplicated, with lowercase
  verbs `read | write | ddl`.
- `statement.text` (the SQL) is present only when the tenant enables `--send-statement-text`, so
  SQL literals do not land in your decision logs by default.
- A statement with no table references (`COMMIT`, `SET`, `USE`, `SHOW`) is admitted without
  calling OPA, so the `statement` rule never sees an empty `accesses`.

### Result

```json
{"result": {"allow": true}}
{"result": {"allow": false, "reason": "emea analysts cannot write lineitem",
            "denied": [{"catalog": "tpch", "schema": "main", "table": "lineitem", "verb": "write"}]}}
```

- `reason` reaches the client after truncation to 256 characters and removal of control
  characters.
- `denied` is advisory: it narrows the error message to the listed accesses. Entries that do not
  match an input access are ignored; a deny with no usable `denied` names every access.
- `decision_id` (top level of OPA's response, present when OPA decision logging is on) is recorded
  on QoD's denial audit row as `opa_decision_id`, next to `authz_source=opa`, so you can join the
  two logs.

### Fail closed

Only a literal JSON `true` at `result.allow` allows.

| OPA response | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `allow: true` | allow |
| `allow: false` | deny, with `reason` and `denied` |
| `allow` missing, `"true"`, `1`, `null`; `result` missing (rule undefined); non-JSON body | deny, "policy error: ..." naming the problem |
| `row_filter` or `masks` present (any value) | deny: reserved for a future version, rejected now |
| timeout, connection refused, non-2xx status, body larger than 1 MiB, no URL configured | error |

How each outcome reaches the client:

| Outcome | Handshake | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| allow | admitted | executed |
| deny | permission refusal, "pool access denied by policy: <reason>" | permission refusal naming the denied tables and the reason |
| error | `UNAVAILABLE`, "authorization service unavailable" (retryable) | same |

An outage is reported as `UNAVAILABLE`, not as a permission error, so clients retry and nobody
chases a phantom grant problem. There is no circuit breaker: during an outage every decision waits
up to `QOD_OPA_TIMEOUT_MS` and is refused. The timeout bounds the whole exchange, including the
response body, and the body is capped at 1 MiB.

## What QoD still enforces on an `opa` tenant

Independently of OPA:

- superuser bypass (superusers never reach OPA);
- user existence, `enabled`, lock, forced password change, session revocation;
- pool lockdown and bucket denial, the protected-write guard, filtered metadata, catalog write
  screening;
- row and column policies (RLS / CLS) from QoD's own policy tables;
- statements QoD cannot authorize precisely (parse errors, unsupported constructs, unqualifiable
  table references) are refused before OPA is called, with no wildcard escape.

## Revocation and caching

- Allow and deny decisions are cached for `QOD_OPA_CACHE_TTL_SEC` seconds. The cache key covers
  every field of the input (and the tenant's OPA settings), so a different question is never
  answered from a cached decision; errors are never cached.
- A Rego or data change applies to new decisions within the TTL. It does **not** kill running
  sessions or statements: pool access is decided at handshake, so a session admitted before the
  change stays connected until it reconnects. Statement decisions re-evaluate within the TTL.
- OPA cannot push a revocation to QoD. QoD-side events (user disabled, locked, deleted, logged out)
  keep their usual behaviour.
- Cost of `QOD_OPA_CACHE_TTL_SEC=0`: the Flight edge authenticates on every RPC and validates a
  statement twice, once in the schema probe (`GetFlightInfo`) and once in the fetch (`DoGet`). With
  the cache off, one FlightSQL statement therefore costs **two statement decisions plus one connect
  decision per RPC**, so OPA sees roughly three calls per query instead of one. The native Quack
  front door and MCP validate once per statement. Keep a small positive TTL unless you need every
  decision re-evaluated on the spot.

## Dry run

```bash
qod tenant opa-test acme --pool bi --user alice                                  # connect
qod tenant opa-test acme --pool bi --user alice --sql "SELECT * FROM orders"     # statement
```

Prints the exact input document and the tenant OPA's answer (`allow`, `deny` or `error`). Nothing
is executed and the decision cache is neither read nor filled. Differences from a live session:
`client.edge` is `dry-run`, `claims` is `{}`, and unqualified tables resolve to the pool's
database and its `main` schema (no session `USE` state).

## Starter policy

[`qod-authz.rego`](qod-authz.rego) (package `qod.authz`) reproduces QoD's own grant semantics
from data you load into OPA, so a migrating tenant starts from equivalence and edits from there:

```json
{"qod": {
  "pool_grants":  {"acme": {"analyst": ["bi"], "admin": ["*"]}},
  "table_grants": {"acme": {"analyst": [{"catalog": "tpch", "schema": "*", "table": "*", "verb": "RO"}]}}
}}
```

- `pool_grants[tenant][role]`: pool names the role may connect to, `"*"` for every pool. A
  branch pool is allowed when the role holds any of its parent pools.
- `table_grants[tenant][role]`: `catalog` / `schema` / `table` patterns (`"*"` matches anything)
  with a verb: `RO` covers read, `RW` read and write, `DDL` ddl, `ALL` everything.

Run it locally:

```bash
opa run --server --addr 127.0.0.1:8181 qod-authz.rego grants.json
QOD_OPA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8181 ...           # or per tenant: qod tenant set-acl acme --opa-url ...
qod tenant set-acl acme --mode opa
qod tenant opa-test acme --pool bi --user alice --sql "SELECT * FROM tpch.main.orders"
```

## Known limitation: FlightSQL denials in the schema probe are not audited

A FlightSQL client asks for the result schema (`GetFlightInfo`) before it fetches rows (`DoGet`).
QoD validates the statement at both steps, but the schema probe runs without journaling, so a
statement OPA denies is refused at the probe and **no denial audit row** is written for it; the
`authz_source=opa` / `opa_decision_id` row only appears for denials reached through the fetch, the
native Quack front door, MCP or the REST preview. This is pre-existing behaviour of the Flight edge
and applies to QoD-mode denials alike. Enable OPA decision logging if you need a complete record of
FlightSQL denials.

## Known limitation: catalog listings

With filtered metadata on (`QOD_ACL_FILTERED_METADATA`, default true), `information_schema` and
`duckdb_*` listings are narrowed by **QoD grants**, not by OPA. An `opa` tenant whose users hold
no QoD role permissions therefore sees empty catalog listings: this fails closed (nothing leaks),
but BI tools that browse the catalog show no tables, even though queries OPA allows run normally.
