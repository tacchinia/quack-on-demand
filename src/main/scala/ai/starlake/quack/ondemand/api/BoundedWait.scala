/** A BOUNDED WAIT over a statement that closes a result arriving too late (REST edge design, spec
  * 2026-09-25 §7.2).
  *
  * `IO.timeoutTo` is the wrong tool for a node call. The call is `IO.blocking`, which cancellation
  * cannot interrupt, so `timeoutTo` sits on it until the node answers, and when the answer does
  * arrive the cancelled fiber drops it, leaking its Arrow reader and its kill-registry entry. Here
  * the statement runs on its own fiber that is never cancelled: the caller stops waiting at the
  * limit, and whichever of the two moves second takes ownership of the result, so a late result is
  * closed exactly once and a result delivered in time is the caller's alone to close.
  *
  * This is NOT a cancellation: the node keeps executing the statement to completion, as before.
  * Durable node-side cancellation is deliberately out of scope (spec §2.4 O-4).

    * is itself cancelled (an outer timeout, a disconnect). A late `Left` or a late error is
