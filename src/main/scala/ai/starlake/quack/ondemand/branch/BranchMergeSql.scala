/** Renders the fast-forward merge batch (design section 4.5): one DuckDB transaction on a node that
  * has the parent catalog attached under `parentAlias` and the branch catalog attached under
  * `branchAlias`. Pure string building; identifiers are double-quoted, literals escaped.
  *
  * Row arithmetic for a `Modified` table over the branch change feed `(fork, head]`:
  *   - delete on main every rowid the branch deleted or updated (pre-images);
  *   - insert on main the CURRENT branch row of every rowid the branch inserted or updated
  *     (post-images). A row inserted then deleted on the branch is absent at head, so the second
  *     step inserts nothing for it; a pre-existing row updated then deleted is deleted by the first
  *     step and not re-inserted. `rowid` is stable across the clone (verified live) and DuckLake
  *     keeps it on UPDATE, which is why the feed, not an anti-join, drives the merge.
