  * reference of the SESSION catalog is replaced by a derived table whose WHERE keeps the system
  * rows plus the rows covered by a Read-covering grant, and each unqualified no-argument call of
  * DuckDB's catalog functions `duckdb_tables()` / `duckdb_views()` / `duckdb_schemas()` /
  * `duckdb_columns()` by one whose WHERE pins `database_name` to the session catalog and keeps the
  * granted rows (issue #114: the quack client's ATTACH syncs the remote catalog through
  * `duckdb_tables() UNION ALL duckdb_views()`). Runs for every non-superuser principal without an
  * explicit information_schema grant; the ACL validator implicitly admits exactly the references
  * this class filters (same flag, same [[FilterableTables]] / [[FilterableFunctions]] lists).
  *
  * Fail-closed, and DENIAL is how it stays that way: a filterable reference the substitution walk
  * cannot reach is refused, not filtered. The walk alone cannot promise this (SQL puts tables in
  * more places than it visits), so two independent counts of the statement's filterable references
  * are taken up front and both must be covered by the substitutions:
  *
  *   - AST occurrences, tallied on jsqlparser's own traversal by node identity. Exact where the
  *     traversal reaches, blind where it does not (ORDER BY, GROUP BY and window PARTITION BY
  *     subqueries are NOT visited - the same blind spots as the walk, which is why one count is not
  *     enough).
  *   - A textual count over jsqlparser's NORMALIZED re-serialization of the statement. Coarser, but
  *     `toString` prints the whole AST, so it sees the positions the traversal skips, and sees them
  *     in the printer's canonical spelling rather than the caller's: comments gone, whitespace
  *     uniform, quoting from a finite deterministic set. Counting the caller's own text instead
  *     cannot work - a comment between the schema name and the dot separates tokens for the lexer
  *     but not for a regex, so the reference reads as one to the parser and none to the count (see
  *     [[MetadataFilterRewriter.textualRefCount]]).
  *
  * Neither tier subsumes the other: the serialized text sees positions the traversal skips, the AST
  * sees quoting forms the regex cannot read through.
  *
  * A count that cannot be taken is also a denial. Three consequences are accepted deliberately: a
  * reference in an unsupported position is denied rather than filtered; a statement that merely
  * MENTIONS a filterable table inside a STRING LITERAL is denied on the phantom match (literals
  * survive serialization, comments do not); and a CROSS-CATALOG filterable reference sitting in a
  * traversal blind spot is denied even though the walk leaves cross-catalog metadata alone on
  * purpose (rare, fail-closed, and the validator would have grant-gated that reference anyway).

    *   - It is immune to lexical trickery. Comments are gone (an interior comment between the
    *     schema name and the dot separates tokens for the lexer but not for a regex, so such a
    *     reference counted as zero against the caller's text while the parser read it as one),
    *     whitespace is canonical, and quoting is the printer's.

    * It can still OVER-count: a filterable name inside a string literal survives serialization and
