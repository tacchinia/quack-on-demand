/** Parquet (`application/vnd.apache.parquet`) for `/rows`, streamed with bounded memory and no
  * dependency the manager does not already ship.
  *
  * Parquet is written by an in-process DuckDB (the `duckdb_jdbc` the manager already embeds, whose
  * Parquet writer is built in): the capped Arrow result is exported over the Arrow C stream
  * interface (`arrow-c-data`, already on the classpath) and registered as a scan, and `COPY ... TO`
  * writes it into a named pipe whose read end IS the HTTP body. Nothing touches the disk: the pipe
  * is a kernel buffer, and DuckDB holds at most one row group plus the Arrow batch being scanned,
  * whatever the page size. DuckDB writes the file front to back with no seeks (`USE_TMP_FILE false`
  * keeps it from writing elsewhere and renaming over the pipe).
  *
  * Row groups are bounded by rows, sized from the first batch so that one holds about
  * [[RowGroupTargetBytes]] of Arrow data (at most [[RowGroupRows]] rows): DuckDB's own
  * `ROW_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES` is refused while insertion order is preserved, which an ordered page
  * needs. A row much wider than the first batch's can still outgrow the instance's memory limit;
  * the COPY then fails and the stream aborts.
  *
  * The in-process instance is locked down before the scan: one thread, a memory limit
  * ([[MemoryLimit]], outside the JVM heap), no extension install or autoload, external access off
  * with only the pipe's private directory allowed, and the configuration locked. The only SQL it
  * runs is fixed text naming the pipe. The edge bounds how many run at once
  * (`maxConcurrentParquet`, and one per principal).
  *
  * A named pipe needs a POSIX host ([[RestParquetWriter.available]]); elsewhere (Windows) Parquet
  * is not offered and asking for it is the usual 406.
  *
  * Lifecycle: [[RestParquetWriter.open]] pulls the first Arrow batch and the first Parquet bytes,
  * so a failure in either is an ordinary error response; [[rest]] streams the remainder and fails
  * (an aborted connection) when the COPY fails after the first byte; [[abort]] makes whatever the
  * write is blocked on return (a deadline, a cancel); [[close]] tears everything down once, in an
  * order that never releases the Arrow result while DuckDB may still be reading it.
