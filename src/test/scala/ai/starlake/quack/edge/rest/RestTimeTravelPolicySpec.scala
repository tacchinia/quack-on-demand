/** Spike S1 / test P1 of the REST edge design (spec 2026-09-25-quack-rest-data-edge-design §2.5,
  * §11.4): do the column- and row-policy rewriters keep `AT (VERSION => n)` on a three-part table
  * reference AND still apply the policy? The edge sends both its schema probe and its data
  * statement with the same `AT` id on a DuckLake tenant-db (§6.3, §6.6).
  *
  * Finding (2026-09-26): the ACL validator and the metadata filter strip the clause before parsing
  * (SqlParser.stripTimeTravelClauses), but ColumnPolicyRewriter and RowPolicyRewriter parse the raw
  * text, where jsqlparser rejects the clause. Both report a parse failure and the router refuses
  * the statement fail-closed: nothing leaks, but a principal holding any column or row policy on
  * the tenant-db cannot read at a snapshot at all.
  *
  * Fixed (2026-09-26) in the rewriters, per constraint 1: both strip the clause with the
  * validator's own scanner and put it back on the same table reference (TimeTravelCarrier), inside
  * the row-policy wrapper on the base table. A clause that cannot be pinned to a table reference
  * still fails closed.
